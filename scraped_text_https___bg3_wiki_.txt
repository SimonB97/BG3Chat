Attack Roll

For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see Die Rolls.
An Attack Roll happens when the game wants to decide whether an attack will hit its target.  The Attack Roll uses a D20 and can be affected by Modifiers such as the Ability Score Modifier and Proficiency Bonus of the creature making the attack.

Result =  D20 + Ability Score Modifier + (optional) Proficiency Bonus
The result of the roll is compared to the Armour Class of the target.  If the Armour Class is reached or exceeded, the attack is a successful hit, and the game proceeds with a Damage Roll to determine the amount of damage dealt.
Attacks done with Weapons always use an Attack Roll to determine success.  Some spells also use an Attack Roll to determine whether they hit their intended target (such as Fire Bolt or Eldritch Blast), though other spells hit the target automatically (such as Magic Missile or Fireball).  A spell that hits its target automatically may allow the target to make a Saving Throw instead.

Critical Miss / Critical Hit[edit | edit source]
 Example of a Critical Hit with a 1d6 Shortsword
As a special case, a roll of 1 means that the attack fails to connect, regardless of bonuses or the target's Armour Class.  This is called a Critical Miss. 
Likewise, a roll of 20 means the attack succeeds regardless of the target's Armour Class.  This is called a Critical Hit.  A critical hit rolls all the damage dice of the attack twice, including damage dice from other sources such as sneak attacks, poison, and Paladin smites.

Modifiers[edit | edit source]
Attack Rolls can be affected by  Advantage/ Disadvantage, by the attacker's Ability Score Modifier, the attacker's Proficiency Bonus, Weapon Enchantments, Bless, High Ground/Low Ground, Bane, Loviatar's Blessing, Magic Weapon, Sacred Weapon, and Archery Fighting Style.

Ability Score Modifier[edit | edit source]
A bonus or penalty may be applied to the result of the roll based on an Ability Score.  Which ability is used depends on the type of attack being made.

Weapons[edit | edit source]
Melee and ranged weapon attacks use Strength or Dexterity, depending on the weapon: usually Strength for melee weapons and Dexterity for ranged weapons.  The exceptions to this rule are Finesse weapons, which automatically select Strength or Dexterity, whichever score is higher; and Thrown weapons, which use Strength for both melee and ranged attacks.  If a weapon is both Thrown and Finesse, it uses the higher of Strength and Dexterity for both melee and ranged attacks.
Some examples, to make the possible combinations of Finesse and Thrown easier to understand:

Using a Maul for a melee attack always uses Strength.
Using a Rapier (Finesse) for a melee attack uses Strength or Dexterity; whichever the attacking creature has a higher score in.
Shooting a Longbow for a ranged attack always uses Dexterity.
Throwing a Handaxe (Thrown) for a ranged attack uses Strength.
Throwing a Dagger (Finesse & Thrown) for a ranged attack uses Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher.
Spells[edit | edit source]
For spells, the Ability Score used for the Modifier depends on the class of the caster:

Classes sorted by which Ability Score they use for Spellcasting

Intelligence
Wisdom
Charisma

Wizard
Arcane Trickster (Rogue)
Eldritch Knight (Fighter)

Cleric
Druid
Ranger

Bard
Paladin
Sorcerer
Warlock
Barbarian (Scrolls only)

In Baldur's Gate 3, the same ability modifiers apply when casting a spell from a Scroll, even when the spell being cast is not normally available to your class. For instance, a Sorcerer casting  Guiding Bolt (a Cleric-only spell) from a scroll adds its Charisma modifier to the Attack Roll of the spell.

Value of the Modifier[edit | edit source]
Whichever Ability Score ends up being used, the bonus or penalty value is based on this table, depending on how high the used Ability Score is:

Proficiency Bonus[edit | edit source]
The attacking creature's Proficiency Bonus is added to the result of the roll if the creature has the correct kind of Proficiency for the attack it's making.
For weapon attacks, the creature must have proficiency in the weapon it's using to make the attack.
For spell attacks, the creature must have innate spell casting capabilities granted by its Class, Subclass, or Feats. As a notable exception, despite not being able to cast spells normally, Barbarians receive their Proficiency Bonus when casting spells from Scrolls (as of Early Access Patch 9).
The value of the bonus depends on the attacking creature's Level:

Damage Roll - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Damage Roll

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see Die Rolls.
A Damage Roll happens when the game wants to determine the damage done by a successful attack, area of effect spell, trap, and so on.  It can involve one or many dice of any type.  This is not to be confused with the Attack Roll, which is a D20 roll deciding whether the attack hits at all.
For example, a successful attack with a Dagger leads to a D4 being rolled to determine the damage (referred to as 1d4) for a total damage of 1 to 4, and a successful attack with a Greatsword leads to two D6 being rolled (referred to as 2d6) for a total damage of 2 to 12.  Being caught in a Fireball will cause 8d6 points of damage, though a successful Saving Throw can reduce it to half.

Modifiers[edit | edit source]
For Weapon attacks, the attacking creature's Ability Score Modifier for Strength or Dexterity is added as a bonus to the total value of the damage roll.  For the damage of Spell attacks, no such modifier exists, unless explicitly granted by a magical item, spell, or class feature (such as the Agonising Blast Eldritch Invocation for Warlocks).
The Proficiency Bonus and Advantage mechanics don't apply to Damage Rolls.

Ability Score Modifier[edit | edit source]
A bonus or penalty may be applied to the result of the roll based on either Strength or Dexterity.  For rolls involving multiple dice, such as 2d4, the dice are rolled together, and the modifier is applied to the total result, not to each die.
Whether Strength or Dexterity is used depends on the weapon: usually Strength for melee weapons and Dexterity for ranged weapons.  The exceptions to this rule are Finesse weapons, which automatically select Strength or Dexterity, whichever score is higher; and Thrown weapons, which use Strength for both melee and ranged attacks.  If a weapon is both Thrown and Finesse, it uses the higher of Strength and Dexterity for both melee and ranged attacks.
Some examples, to make the possible combinations of Finesse and Thrown easier to understand:

Using a Maul for a melee attack always uses Strength.
Using a Rapier (Finesse) for a melee attack uses Strength or Dexterity; whichever the attacking creature has a higher score in.
Shooting a Longbow for a ranged attack always uses Dexterity.
Throwing a Handaxe (Thrown) for a ranged attack uses Strength.
Throwing a Dagger (Finesse & Thrown) for a ranged attack uses Strength or Dexterity, whichever is higher.
Whether it's Strength or Dexterity that ends up being used, the following table defines the value of the modifier:

A bit of Mathematics[edit | edit source]
Note that due to the mathematics of dice rolls, the difference between, say, 1d8 and 2d4 is more than just the higher minimum value of 2 on the 2d4 roll.  With the d8, you have an equal chance of getting, say, a 5 and an 8.  On the other hand, the 2d4 roll is statistically more likely to lead to a total value of 5, than a total value of 8.  This is most easily explained with a table of all possible outcomes:

Possible results of a 2d4 roll, highlighting the number of possibilities resulting in a total value of 5

First roll
Second roll

Notice how often the 5 appears in the possibilities for the total value (4 out of 16 possibilities) vs. how often the 8 appears (1 out of 16).  This means a 2d4 roll has a 25% chance of resulting in 5 points of damage, but only a 6.125% chance of resulting in 8 points of damage.  Meanwhile, the 1d8 roll actually has a higher chance of resulting in the maximum damage value of 8, since 1 out of 8 possibilities (12.5%) result in an 8.

Origin - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Origin

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki
(Redirected from Origins)

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The player avatar's Origin is what defines their previous history and relation to the world around them. 
Picking an Origin is the first choice in Character Creation when starting a new game. The player can choose to create a completely custom character, or choose from one of 7 Origin Characters, each which has their own unique stories, desires, and attitudes toward the world around them.
If not chosen as the player avatar, each Origin Character (except The Dark Urge) appears in the game world as companions, who the player may choose to recruit into their party throughout their journey.
Once the correct NPC is discovered, the player and origin companions may change their class and attributes.  Note, Backgrounds cannot be changed.

Custom[edit | edit source]
Create a completely custom character.

You’ve always felt you had a greater calling, but it has never borne fruit. Everything changes when you awaken imprisoned on an alien ship. Perhaps your time has finally come.

Astarion[edit | edit source]
Play as Astarion the Rogue.

Astarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries, forced to follow the orders of his sadistic master, Cazador: seduce every fool with a pulse, and lure them back to Cazador's lair. Free for now, Astarion will do anything to keep his life in the light. He can see but one way to ensure his liberty for good: become many times more powerful than his old abuser could ever dream of being. 
His body is forever tainted by the intricate, patterned scarring Cazador carved upon his back, and the elder vampire seems set on sending out waves of hunters seeking to capture his lost spawn.

Gale[edit | edit source]
Play as Gale the Wizard.

What’s a god to a world-class wizard? Gale was once a formidable archmage in Waterdeep, but pushed his relationship with the goddess Mystra too far. Failing to usurp his former lover’s godhood, the goddess stole Gale’s magics away and cursed him with the Netherese Orb, a dangerous artefact with enough magical potential energy in it to level a city if it were allowed to escape.
Beyond learning the lesson for his hubris, Gale has now become beset with concern for the danger he poses to others around him, and is worried that if he undergoes ceremorphosis, the angry Orb could imperil countless lives if he can’t neutralise it first.

Karlach[edit | edit source]
Play as Karlach the Barbarian.

Fresh-escaped from Hell, Karlach is finally free of the archdevil Zariel - but not from the infernal engine Zariel planted in her chest. With her first taste of freedom in ten years, Karlach is eager to find a fix for the engine that's burning hotter and hotter before it burns her out completely. But even more premier in her mind? Exploring, finding like-minded travellers, falling in love (or lust)... and taking revenge on the man who sold her to Zariel all those years ago.

Lae'zel[edit | edit source]
Play as Lae'zel the Fighter.

Crashed down to the Sword Coast from the stars, Lae'zel is a fierce warrior, even by the standards of militant githyanki society. When faced with the possibility of becoming a mind flayer, the monster she has dedicated her life to defeating, she must prove her worth and earn the right to rejoin her people -- if they don't execute her first. Will Lae'zel's strength and determination be enough to prove herself to Queen Vlaakith, or must she walk another path in exile?

Shadowheart[edit | edit source]
Play as Shadowheart the Cleric.

A devoted cleric of Shar, goddess of darkness and loss, Shadowheart agreed to have her memories wiped as part of a holy mission. Now its sole survivor, she must deliver a powerful relic back to her kin in order to win Shar's love and have her memories restored – but all the while, she is tormented by strange, painful magic that she struggles to understand.

Wyll[edit | edit source]
Play as Wyll the Warlock.

From a scion of a famed Baldurian house to a life of adventure on the road, Wyll’s life as the monster hunter called the Blade of Frontiers has made him one of the beating hearts of the Sword Coast. While he has done great deeds for the Coast’s people, the source of his power remains secret. The cambion Mizora drew Wyll into a warlock’s pact in a moment with many lives at stake, and cursed him with the duty of hunting her enemies. Mizora only asks Wyll to sacrifice devilish creatures to her, but a cambion’s ambitions are ever fickle, and Wyll wishes to escape the pact before its price grows cruel.

The Dark Urge[edit | edit source]
Play a custom character with the The Dark Urge.

You remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a path paved with blood. As you venture on, you find yourself inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties. Where do these thoughts come from?

Background[edit | edit source]
Karlach was a citizen of Elturel before being taken prisoner and forced to fight in the Blood War, the eternal conflict between demons and devils. She was a prisoner and champion of Zariel, Archdevil and ruler of Avernus, the first layer of the Nine Hells. Taking a risky chance on escape, Karlach boarded a hostile Mind Flayer ship when it appeared in the sky of Avernus. Using it, she made her escape from the Hells but was infected with a Mind Flayer Tadpole in the process. Now hunted, Karlach is a fugitive on the run from Zariel's forces, who seeks to have her warrior returned to her, and punished.

Personality[edit | edit source]
Karlach is a foul-mouthed and brusque warrior. She's independent, but not afraid to accept outside help when necessary.

Classes

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search

A character's class in Baldur's Gate 3 is one of their primary defining features. Each class represents a different calling, and each offers a number of unique abilities, powers, and skills that influence how that character is able to interact with the world. Classes determine most of a character's abilities - both in and out of combat. As a character advances in levels in a class they will gain incredible new powers and abilities. 
The maximum character level in Baldur's Gate 3 is level 12.
Each class grants characters special dialogue choices only available to that class. Each class also has unique spellcasting animations (while attack animations are based on race).

Game Mechanics[edit | edit source]

Subclasses[edit | edit source]
When a character reaches a certain level in a class they must select a subclass. The level that this choice is made at varies from class to class.
Subclasses allow characters to further specialize their character by imparting powerful new abilities focused around enhancing the central theme of the subclass. Choosing a subclass does not cause a character to stop gaining the normal benefits of a class when advancing in level - the benefits of a subclass are on top of the normal class abilities.

See below for a list of classes and their subclasses.

Multiclassing[edit | edit source]
A character's choice of class is not permanent. When gaining a new level, a character can choose to continue advancing in level in a class they already have levels in, or they can choose to gain a level in an entirely new class. This is called multiclassing. Doing so will grant most of the benefits of advancing in level in that additional class, with some limitations.
A multiclassed character does not receive all of the proficiencies of their new class. Multiclassing never grants saving throw proficiencies. A multiclassed character's proficiency bonus increases as normal, however.
A multiclassed character adds their total level in all classes together to determine their overall character level.

Damage Types - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Damage Types

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Every source of damage in the game, such as attacks, spells, or traps, has an associated Damage Type.  The target may have resistances or weaknesses that affect how much damage it takes from this source of damage.

Contents

1 Damage Types
2 Damage Vulnerability, Resistance and Immunity

2.1 Vulnerability
2.2 Resistance
2.3 Immunity

3 Toughness

Damage Types[edit | edit source]
There are 13 different types of damage in Baldur's Gate 3. They are:

  Bludgeoning*

  Piercing*

  Slashing*

  Cold

  Fire

  Acid

  Lightning

  Force

  Poison

  Thunder

  Radiant

  Necrotic

-

  Psychic

-

*Sometimes, the term Physical Damage (stylized as  Physical on the wiki) is used in ability or item descriptions, such as the Rage ability of Barbarians.  When you use such an ability, you deal whatever damage type your weapon would deal.

Damage Vulnerability, Resistance and Immunity[edit | edit source]
Vulnerability, Resistance, and Immunity are properties that modify how much damage a target takes from specific types of damage.

Vulnerability[edit | edit source]
Vulnerability means the total damage taken from a type of damage is doubled.

Resistance[edit | edit source]
Resistance means the total damage taken from a type of damage is halved.

Immunity[edit | edit source]
Immunity means the total damage taken from a type of damage is reduced to 0.

Toughness[edit | edit source]
 Example of a wall with Lesser Toughness
Toughness is a special property of some doors, chests, and breakable walls that requires a hit to exceed a certain damage threshold in order to deal any damage. The possible levels of Toughness are:

Lesser Toughness: Only a hit that deals at least 10 damage can damage this material.
Medium Toughness: Only a hit that deals at least 22 damage can damage this material.
Greater Toughness: Only a hit that deals at least 50 damage can damage this material. (Not yet implemented in Early Access.)
All modifiers of the hit and vulnerabilities/resistances of the object are calculated first and then checked against the Toughness damage threshold.
There are several ways to beat the Toughness threshold of an object. Here are some common methods:

Exploiting any specific damage Vulnerability of the material (typically  Fire for wood,  Force for stone, and  Acid for metal)
Attacking with a Maul using Great Weapon Master: All In to deal high  Bludgeoning damage
Using the Shatter spell or another source of high  Thunder damage
Igniting Smokepowder Barrels or other explosives

 Gather your party and return to the Forgotten Realms in a tale of fellowship and betrayal, sacrifice and survival, and the lure of absolute power.
Mysterious abilities are awakening inside you, drawn from a mind flayer parasite planted in your brain. Resist, and turn darkness against itself. Or embrace corruption, and become ultimate evil.

From the creators of Divinity: Original Sin 2 comes a next-generation RPG, set in the world of Dungeons & Dragons. 
Baldur's Gate 3 is a fantasy roleplaying videogame made by Larian Studios in which the main campaign takes place in the Forgotten Realms setting. It's based on a modified version of the 5th Edition of Dungeons & Dragons as a sequel to Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and their respective expansions. The game was announced on June 6th, 2019 and released as an Early Access game on October 6th, 2020. The full release is scheduled for August 3, 2023 for PC users and September 6, 2023 for PS5 users.

Plot[edit | edit source]
For a thorough walkthrough see Prologue
The game starts in the year of 1492 DR, over 120 years after the events of Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn and months after the events of Baldur's Gate: Descent into Avernus. The player character can be one of the pre-made characters or a custom origin (the default name is Tav, however the player can name their character whatever they like). The protagonist has been taken captive by the mind flayers, who have launched an invasion of Faerûn. They have implanted the protagonist, as well as a host of other creatures, with illithid tadpoles, parasites capable of enthralling and transforming them into other mind flayers; however, before the mind flayers can transform their victims, the nautiloid flying ship upon which they are all aboard comes under attack from githyanki warriors and their red dragons, and flees through multiple realms, including Avernus, the first of the Nine Hells. 
The protagonist is freed during the fighting and steers the damaged ship back to Faerûn, where it crashes. As the protagonist searches for a way to remove their parasites, they encounter other survivors of the wreck: the human wizard Gale, the half-elf cleric Shadowheart, the high elf vampire rogue Astarion, the human warlock Wyll, the barbarian tiefling Karlach and the githyanki fighter Lae'zel.

 Abducted, infected, lost. You are turning into a monster, but as the corruption inside you grows, so does your power. That power may help you to survive, but there will be a price to pay, and more than any ability, the bonds of trust that you build within your party could be your greatest strength. Caught in a conflict between devils, deities, and sinister otherworldly forces, you will determine the fate of the Forgotten Realms together. 
Character creation[edit | edit source]

 In-game window
Alchemy allows you to turn your collection of herbs, wild mushrooms, crystals, and monster limbs into Potions, Elixirs, Grenades, and Weapon Coatings.

Basic Process[edit | edit source]
It takes 3 of a material to extract it into its usable ingredient form, either a Sublimate, Salt, Essence, Ash, Vitriol, or Suspension. Recipes call for a specific processed material (e.g. Salts of Mugwort) in addition to a generic (e.g. any Suspension). Each alchemical base material converts into only one type of ingredient, so there is no danger in using the "Extract All Ingredients" button. You should choose which ingredient you use in the generic slot carefully, however, as you may need it as a specific in a different recipe. Since you cannot swap out the auto-filled ingredient in the generic slot, make sure to store extracted ingredients in the camp stash and only pull them out as needed to fill your desired recipe.

Ability Scores - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Ability Scores

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
See also: Ability Score Modifier
Ability Scores refer to various core qualities of a creature.  There are a total of six ability scores:

Strength

Dexterity

Constitution

Intelligence

Wisdom

Charisma

Strength: Physical power
Dexterity: Agility and finesse
Constitution: Overall health and endurance
Intelligence: Rational reasoning and memory
Wisdom: Common sense and insight
Charisma: Charm or force of character
An ability score is never less than 1 (except when drained, such as by Devour Intellect), and for common creatures, its natural value can go up to 20.  For example, a simple rat may have a Strength of 1, whereas an exceptionally well-trained fighter could have a Strength of 20.  Through various enhancements, such as magical spells, elixirs, or special equipment, the score may be increased further.  The ability scores of a creature determines its Ability Score Modifiers.

Dice Rolls - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Dice Rolls

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
 A Deception check
Attacking a creature, making a shove attempt, spotting a hidden secret, and picking a lock are all examples of die rolls, which are the main method used to determine character success or failure in BG3. The amount of damage a character deals in combat is also determined by rolling dice.
In most circumstances, when a character makes a die roll, their Ability Score Modifier and Proficiency Bonus are added to the roll to determine the final result.  The most common exception to this is the Damage Roll, which doesn't add a character's proficiency bonus unless explicitly stated.
The various types of dice used in rolls are referred to by the number of sides they have:  D4,  D6,  D8,  D10,  D12, and  D20.  Abbreviations are used to refer to the total number of dice used in a roll, such as 1d6 for rolling one D6 die, 2d4 for rolling two D4 dice, 8d6 for rolling eight D6 dice, and so on.
Some rolls need to reach a certain value to be considered a success.  This is usually done with a  D20, and the target value is called the Difficulty Class of the roll.  Rolling a 1 on a D20 is referred to as a Natural 1 and rolling a 20 is referred to as a Natural 20.  On some rolls, these can have special effects, such as automatically failing or succeeding the roll, ignoring Modifiers and Difficulty Class.

Karmic Dice[edit | edit source]
 The optional Karmic Dice setting, located in Gameplay Options
In Baldur's Gate 3 Early Access, the Karmic Dice option (previously referred to as 'Loaded Dice') is enabled by default. When this option is enabled, the game will avoid frustrating streaks of very low rolls in a row.
However, Karmic Dice influence all rolls - including those of enemies - and the results will only ever skew toward a positive result for the dice roller. In short, the Karmic Dice setting makes combat encounters quicker and deadlier for both you and your enemies. 
The exact algorithm for Karmic Dice is not presently known and may be changed between versions of the game.

Types of Rolls[edit | edit source]
Beyond the general principles explained above, the details of rolls depend on the type of roll that is being made.  Following are the types of rolls in the game.

Attack Roll[edit | edit source]
Main page: Attack Roll
When a creature attacks another, the game rolls a D20.  The result is modified by the attacking creature's Ability Score Modifier and Proficiency Bonus.  If the result matches or exceeds the Armour Class of the target, then the attack is successful.  Otherwise, it's a failure; this could mean the attack was a miss, failed to hurt the target due to its armour, or the target was able to dodge or parry.

Result =  D20 + Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus
Attacks done with Weapons always use an Attack Roll to determine success.  Some spells also use an Attack Roll to determine whether they hit their intended target (such as  Fire Bolt or  Eldritch Blast), though other spells hit the target automatically (such as  Magic Missile or  Fireball).  A spell that hits its target automatically may allow the target to make a Saving Throw instead; see below.
The Attack Roll should not be confused with the Damage Roll, which instead determines the amount of damage done to a target by a successful attack.

Critical Miss / Critical Hit[edit | edit source]
 Example of a Critical Hit with a 1d6 Shortsword
As a special case, a roll of 1 means that the attack fails regardless of bonuses or the target's Armour Class.  This is called a Critical Miss.  
Likewise, a roll of 20 means the attack succeeds regardless of the target's Armour Class.  This is called a Critical Hit.  A critical hit also affects the result of the Damage Roll. Currently, a critical hit doubles all damage dice involved in the damage roll (including additional dice such as those from Smites or Combat Maneuvers), but not the bonuses from modifiers or other flat damage bonuses such as  Great Weapon Master: All In.

Attack Roll Modifiers[edit | edit source]
The Ability Score used for the Ability Score Modifier depends on the type of attack that's being made.  Melee and ranged weapon attacks use Strength or Dexterity, depending on the weapon.  For spells, the Ability Score used for the Modifier generally depends on the class of the caster; see the main Attack Roll page for details.
For the creature's Proficiency Bonus to be added to the roll, the creature must be proficient in the kind of attack it's making.  For weapon attacks, this is based on whether the creature has proficiency in the weapon being used.  For spells, it's based on whether the creature has any innate spell casting capability granted by its class, subclass, or Feats.
Attack Rolls can also have  Advantage /  Disadvantage.

Damage Roll[edit | edit source]
Main page: Damage Roll
A Damage Roll is performed when a successful attack is made, a spell hits a target, a trap is activated, and so on.  The result determines the damage done, in terms of hit-points.  This roll can involve any type and number of dice.
For example, a successful hit with a Dagger will lead to a D4 being rolled to determine the damage (referred to as 1d4 damage), whereas a successful attack with a Greatsword will lead to two D6 being rolled (referred to as 2d6) for a total damage of 2 to 12.  Being caught in a  Fireball will cause 8d6 points of damage, though a successful Saving Throw (see below) can reduce it to half.

Damage Roll Modifiers[edit | edit source]
For attacks made with weapons, the total value resulting from the roll is affected by the attacking creature's Ability Score Modifier.  For the damage of spell attacks, no such modifier applies, except when explicitly granted by a magical item or class feature, such as the Warlock's  Agonising Blast invocation.

Saving Throw[edit | edit source]
Main page: Saving Throw
Various types of danger can be avoided, or their harm reduced, by making a  Saving Throw, also called a save.  This could mean trying to avoid damage from a trap that was just activated, trying to resist the poison of a venomous bite, or trying to take cover to reduce damage from an explosion.
The creature rolls a D20, and adds its Ability Score Modifier and Proficiency Bonus (if Proficient in that type of saving throw).  The result must reach or exceed the Difficulty Class of the Saving Throw.

Result =  D20 + Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if Proficient)
Saving Throw Modifiers[edit | edit source]
Which Ability Score is used for the Modifier depends on the source of danger against which the save is being made.  For example, evading a spike trap may require Dexterity, whereas trying to resist the effects of a poisonous gas would require Constitution.
Depending on the Ability Score, the Saving Throw may be referred to as a Strength Saving Throw, Dexterity Saving Throw, Constitution Saving Throw, and so on.  (Further shortened to Strength Save, Dexterity Save, etc.)  The Proficiency Bonus is only added if the creature has Proficiency in the corresponding type of Saving Throw.  Each Class grants a creature two Saving Throw Proficiencies.

Difficulty Class[edit | edit source]
The Difficulty Class is also determined by the source of danger.  If a creature casts a spell that imposes a Saving Throw on another, the Difficulty Class is determined by the spell caster's Modifiers, using the following formula:

Difficulty Class = 8 + Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus
In other scenarios, such as traps, the game chooses an appropriate Difficulty Class, depending on how serious the danger is.

Effect of Success[edit | edit source]
A successful save could mean completely avoiding negative effects, or it could mean reducing the damage received.  For example, successfully saving against a spike trap could mean that a creature takes no damage at all, because it successfully evaded the spikes.  On the other hand, if it's caught in the area of effect of a  Fireball, then a successful save will merely halve the damage.  Some effects don't allow for a Saving Throw at all, for example the damage taken from  Magic Missile.

Ability Check[edit | edit source]
Main page: Ability Check
Various actions, other than attacking or making a save, still require the creature to make an attempt that may fail.  The creature rolls a D20, and adds its Ability Score Modifier and possibly its Proficiency Bonus.  The attempted action has a specific Difficulty Class which the result of the roll must match or exceed.

Result =  D20 + Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus
Ability Checks can be based purely on an Ability Score, in which case they can only benefit from the Ability Score Modifier, but not the Proficiency Bonus.

Skill Check[edit | edit source]
More commonly, the check will be related to a specific Skill, which not only determines the Ability Score used for the Modifier, but also lets the creature use its Proficiency Bonus if it happens to be Proficient in that particular Skill.  In this case, the check may be called a Skill Check rather than an Ability Check.
For example, when a trap is near a creature, and it's not yet activated, the game rolls a Perception Skill Check (or in short, "rolls Perception") to determine whether the creature notices the trap.  Perception is related to Wisdom, so a creature with high Wisdom will gain a bonus.  If the creature doesn't gain any bonus from Wisdom, it could still gain a bonus from being Proficient in the Perception Skill.  If the creature both has high Wisdom and is proficient in Perception, it gains both bonuses.
Once the trap is seen, the creature may want to disarm it.  This will require a Sleight of Hand Check, which is related to Dexterity.  So, a creature that both has high Dexterity, and Proficiency in Sleight of Hand, can benefit from both types of bonuses when attempting to disarm the trap.

Contest[edit | edit source]
A Contest is a special type of Ability Check in which two creatures both roll an Ability Check or Skill Check to oppose each other, and one wins over the other.  The creatures don't necessarily roll the same type of check.
An example of this is the  Shove action, where the creature attempting the Shove must roll Athletics, and the defending creature is allowed to roll either Athletics or Acrobatics to contest the Shove.  If the attacker's roll is higher than the defender's, the Shove succeeds, otherwise it fails.

Modifiers[edit | edit source]
Rolls can be modified by various bonuses and penalties.  These can take the form of adding or subtracting a value from the result, or requiring two rolls instead of one and taking the lower or higher of the two values.

Advantage / Disadvantage[edit | edit source]
Main page: Advantage
In various situations, a creature can have  Advantage or  Disadvantage on an Attack Roll, Saving Throw, or Ability Check.
Advantage means that you make the roll twice and use the higher result.  Disadvantage means you use the lower result.
Advantage and Disadvantage cannot stack.  In other words, you never roll more than twice.  Additionally, they cancel each other out, no matter how many sources of Advantage or Disadvantage you have.  For instance, if you had three sources of Advantage and only one source of Disadvantage, they would still cancel each other out, causing you to roll normally.

Ability Score Modifier[edit | edit source]
Main page: Ability Score Modifier
A creature's Ability Scores can modify the result of rolls, depending on how high or low the Ability Score is.  Which Ability Score is used to determine the Modifier depends on the roll that's being made.  The Ability Score Modifier for a specific Ability Score can also be referred to by the name of that Ability Score, such as: Strength Modifier, Dexterity Modifier, etc.

For Attack Rolls[edit | edit source]
Weapon attacks will generally use Strength or Dexterity, depending on the weapon and the type of attack made.  See Attack Roll for details.
Spell attacks will use an Ability Score depending on the Class of the creature making it.  Again, see the Attack Roll page for details.

For Damage Rolls[edit | edit source]
For Weapon attacks, the same rules apply to Damage Rolls as for Attack Rolls.  If the Damage Roll involves multiple dice, such as the 2d6 damage of a Greatsword, then the Modifier is applied to the total value, not to each individual die.
For the damage of Spells, there is generally no Ability Score Modifier, though there are exceptions to this rule.  For example,  Agonising Blast allows the Warlock to add its Charisma Modifier to the damage of Eldritch Blast.

For Saving Throws[edit | edit source]
For saves against various threats, the threat in question determines which Ability Score is used to make the save.  For example, the  Web spell requires you to make a Dexterity Save, whereas  Crown of Madness requires a Wisdom Save.
An Ability Score Modifier is also used when a creature imposes a Saving Throw on another, such as by casting a spell.  The Modifier affects the Difficulty Class (DC) of the Save imposed on the target, using the formula: 

Spell Save DC = 8 + Spellcasting Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus
This allows spellcasters to increase the effectiveness of their spells by increasing their Spellcasting Ability Modifier, even when those spells do not involve Attack Rolls.
Note: The Ability Score used to determine the Spell Save DC is not necessarily the same as the type of Saving Throw imposed on targets.  Instead, much like for Attack Rolls, it uses the caster's Spellcasting Ability Modifier. For example, a Wizard's Spell Save DC is determined by their Intelligence modifier, but a creature targeted by a  Web spell cast by a Wizard must still make a Dexterity Save.

For Ability Checks[edit | edit source]
An Ability Check is always based on a specific Ability Score, which determines the Modifier that will be used.  The Skill Check also uses an Ability Score Modifier, since each Skill is based on a specific Ability Score.  For example, an Athletics Check uses Strength, whereas a Sleight of Hand Check uses Dexterity.

Proficiency Bonus[edit | edit source]
Main page: Proficiency Bonus
Creatures can have Proficiency in a number of different areas, allowing them to add their  Proficiency Bonus to related rolls.  Proficiencies can be granted by a creature's Background, Race, Class, and Feats chosen when leveling up.

For Attack Rolls[edit | edit source]
Attack Rolls made with Weapons can benefit from Proficiency with the type of weapon that's being used.  This kind of Proficiency can be granted by the creature's Race, Class, or Feats chosen when leveling up.
Attack Rolls made for spells benefit from Proficiency in spell casting, which all creatures capable of casting spells have.  The creature could have spell casting capabilities due to its Class, or from a Feat it chose when leveling up.

For Saving Throws[edit | edit source]
A creature can have Proficiency in a specific type of Saving Throw, like Strength Saving Throws or Dexterity Saving Throws.  Each Class gains Proficiency in two such types of Saving Throw at level 1, and can add their Proficiency Bonus to those types of Saving Throws.
A creature's Proficiency Bonus also affects the Difficulty Class of the Saving Throw that enemies must roll when affected by that creature's spells (and some non-spell abilities).  The formula for this is: 

Spell Save DC = 8 + Spellcasting Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus
For Ability Checks[edit | edit source]
An Ability Check may be based directly on an Ability Score rather than a Skill, in which case no Proficiency Bonus is possible.  If it's based on a Skill, however, a creature will get a Proficiency Bonus in the corresponding Skill Checks if it's Proficient in that Skill.
Proficiency in a Skill can be granted by Race, Class, or a Feat chosen when leveling up.  For example, all Elves have an innate feature called Keen Senses which grants them Proficiency in Perception.  Rangers can gain Proficiency in a number of skills based on class features they choose: Bounty Hunter grants Proficiency in Investigation, Keeper of the Veil and Mage Breaker both grant Proficiency in Arcana, and so on.  The Skilled Feat, if chosen when leveling up, allows a creature to gain Proficiency in any three Skills.

Ability Check - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Ability Check

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see Die Rolls.
The game rolls an Ability Check to determine whether a creature will succeed or fail in various scenarios.  The creature rolls a D20, and adds its Ability Score Modifier and possibly a Proficiency Bonus.  To succeed, the result must reach or exceed a Difficulty Class, which depends on what the creature is trying to accomplish.

Result =  D20 + Ability Score Modifier + (optional) Proficiency Bonus
Ability Checks can be based purely on an Ability Score, in which case they can only benefit from the Ability Score Modifier.  More commonly, they will be a Skill Check, where the Proficiency Bonus can be added as well if the creature is Proficient in the given Skill.

Contents

1 Skill Check

1.1 Strength
1.2 Dexterity
1.3 Constitution
1.4 Intelligence
1.5 Wisdom
1.6 Charisma

2 Contest
3 Modifiers

Skill Check[edit | edit source]
A Skill Check is a type of Ability Check tied to a Skill in which a creature may have Proficiency.  The Skill also determines the Ability Score used for the Ability Score Modifier.
For example, when a trap is nearby, the game rolls a Perception Check (or in short, "rolls Perception").  Perception is related to Wisdom, so the creature's Wisdom Ability Score Modifier is applied.  If the creature is Proficient in Perception, then the creature's Proficiency Bonus is also added.
Proficiency in a Skill can be granted by Race, Class, or a Feat chosen when leveling up.
For example, all Elves have an innate feature called Keen Senses which grants them Proficiency in Perception.  Wood Elves have an additional feature called Mask of the Wild, which gives them Proficiency in Stealth.  Rangers can gain Proficiency in a number of skills based on specific class features they choose at level 1: Bounty Hunter grants Proficiency in Investigation, Keeper of the Veil and Mage Breaker grant Proficiency in Arcana, and so on.
The Skilled Feat, if chosen when leveling up, allows a creature to gain Proficiency in any three Skills.
Following is the list of Skills that a creature can be Proficient in, sorted by the Ability Score which the skill is related to:

Strength
Athletics

Dexterity
Acrobatics
Sleight of Hand

Contest[edit | edit source]
A special type of Ability Check is called the Contest, in which two creatures both roll an Ability Check or Skill Check to contest each other, and one wins over the other.  The creatures don't necessarily roll the same type of check.
An example of this is the Shove action, where the creature attempting the Shove must roll Athletics, and the defending creature is allowed to roll either Athletics or Acrobatics to contest the Shove.  If the attacker's roll is higher than the defender's, the Shove succeeds, otherwise it fails.

Initiative - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Initiative

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Initiative determines the order of turns during combat.

Rolling Initiative[edit | edit source]
When combat begins, every participating combatant rolls  D20 + Dexterity Modifier to determine their position in the initiative order. The participant with the highest roll goes first and the particpant with the lowest roll goes last. If two participants roll the same Initiative result, the one with a higher Dexterity Score goes first.

Surprised[edit | edit source]
Surprised is a special condition that overrides the initiative roll made by a creature for the first round of combat. When one side of a combat encounter is unaware of the other side, they may be surprised. A surprised creature cannot take any Actions or Reactions for one combat round.
Surprise can be achieved when initiating combat by attacking an unaware enemy while Hidden.
Notes about surprised:

Some creatures, even when surprised themselves, may call out to nearby allies to prevent them from being surprised.
Certain combat encounters are rigged to always surprise either the player's party or the enemy party when the proper conditions are met. For example:
The first encounter with the Lesser Imps during the Prologue always grants the player a surprise round.
A Mimic will always surprise the player's party when interacting with the object it's disguised as.

Companions - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Companions

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
This page was last confirmed to be up-to-date at:  2023-08-09 

Companions are playable characters who can join and fight alongside the player. Each has their own motivations, personalities, and affinity that increase or decrease according to the player's choices. At high approval levels, many companions can be Romanced. Conversely, a companion may leave the party or even try to kill the player if their approval becomes too low.
Since the game's initial release, the default Class of companions can be changed. However, for story purposes, the game acts as if they have their original Class.
See also: Camp Followers.

Origin Companions[edit | edit source]
Origin Companions are playable characters with rich backgrounds and ties to the world and the events of the game. Each Origin can be selected as a player character as an alternative to making a custom character. These origin companions can be recruited shortly after completing the Prologue.

Gameplay[edit | edit source]
As a Wizard, Gale excels at learning and casting a wide variety of arcane Spells. Using his Arcane Recovery ability, he can keep casting spells long after other spellcasters have run out of Spell Slots.
Wizards have the unique ability to learn more spells from spell scrolls they find in their travels, although these spells must be ones they could normally learn on a level-up.
At Level 2, Gale can specialise in a school of magic, allowing him to learn spells from that school of magic for reduced cost. This specialization also grants Gale extremely powerful bonuses to spells cast from that school of magic.

Recruitment[edit | edit source]
Gale can be recruited in Chapter One.

Gale is first encountered when approaching the Roadside Cliffs Ancient Rune Circle, north of the Ravaged Beach and near the Nautiloid crash site. Upon drawing near the circle, Gale will emerge from it. He will suggest joining forces to increase their chances of finding a solution to their Tadpole infection. If the player agrees, Gale will join the party.
It is possible to fail the Strength checks needed to pull him out of the portal.

Background[edit | edit source]
From a young age, Gale was a prodigy with magic, manipulating magic like a skilled virtuoso plays music. His talent drew the attention of the Goddess of Magic herself, Mystra, whom was so taken by his skill that she revealed to him arcane secrets known by few others. They shared an intimate relationship until one day Mystra grew distant and disappeared, seemingly displeased with Gale. Spurned by his goddess, Gale lost most of his incredible magical prowess, although he was still a more than capable wizard.
Determined to gain her affections back, Gale sought out a dangerous tome with the objective of returning some lost magic back to his beloved goddess. Ultimately, Gale failed in his endeavor and his body became an unwitting host to an extremely destructive Netherese orb. To keep the orb inhabiting and corrupting his body in check, Gale must continually sate it with powerful magical artefacts - if he fails, the orb will detonate, bearing enough destructive power to bring down even whole cities, and Gale with them.

Personality[edit | edit source]
Gale can come off as proud or arrogant, but will also treat those in need with kindness. He tends to ponder intellectually and looks at everything with a pragmatic and analytical view. Gale tends to be evasive about himself and his past, often changing topics or asking listeners to remain non-judgmental during his stories.

Interactions[edit | edit source]
Approval[edit | edit source]
Gale generally approves of doing good and helping those in need. He approves of solving conflicts with diplomacy and appreciates thoughtful or pragmatic solutions.
The following story and dialogue choices will cause Gale to gain approval.

Creating an Account[edit source]
Creating an account is an optional step that allows you to customize your wiki settings and attributes wiki edits to you. You can edit pages without an account, but your IP address will be publicly logged.

Identifying Areas in Need of Help[edit source]
It's not always obvious where to start. If you're looking for inspiration, try checking the following:

Special:WantedPages: A list of pages that are linked to by other pages, but have not yet been created themselves
Special:AncientPages: Pages that have not been updated in a long time - check these for outdated information
Special:LonelyPages: Pages that aren't linked to by any other pages - try to find other appropriate pages to add links to them
Special:LongPages: Very long pages that might benefit from editing for brevity
Special:ShortPages: Very short pages that might benefit from adding more information
BG3Wiki:Verification: Pages marked as having information that needs to be verified.
See Special:SpecialPages for a full list of Special pages.

Working with Pages[edit source]
This is just a basic introduction to working with wiki pages. Refer to MediaWiki Help:Contents for overall MediaWiki help, or MediaWiki Help:Formatting for detailed help with MediaWiki markup.

Create a New Page[edit source]
 Visual Editor and Source Editor buttons
 Switching between editor types
To create a new page, either click on a broken (red) link or use your browser to type the URL of a page that doesn't yet exist (for example, https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Page_That_Does_Not_Exist). If you're not automatically taken to the editor, click either Edit (to open the Visual Editor) or Edit source (to open the Source Editor).

The Visual Editor is helpful for contributors who are new or not yet familiar with wiki markup, but it doesn't allow you to directly manipulate wiki markup.
The Source Editor is more powerful and flexible, but requires at least a basic understanding of wiki markup.
Edit an Existing Page[edit source]
Similarly, to edit an existing page, click either Edit (opens Visual Editor) or Edit source (opens Source Editor) above the page. Within either editor view, you can switch between the Visual Editor and the Source Editor at any time via the upper-right menu button.
When you've finished editing, be sure to add a brief Summary of your changes and click the Save changes button!
Want to give it a go? Check a random page and see if you can improve it!

Page History[edit source]
Click the View history button above a page to see a history of edits performed on that page. Each line describes a revision of the page, including date/time, the contributor who made that edit, and (ideally) the reason for the edit. This can be helpful if you're not sure why an edit was made.
Remember: The wiki is a living project, and wiki editing is a collaborative effort! Be prepared for your contributions to be tweaked, copyedited, hacked to pieces, or completely deleted.

Finding Wiki Content[edit source]
Bypassing Google Search[edit source]
See Help:Searching for BG3Wiki for browser-specific instructions on how to more quickly and easily find wiki pages at any time.

Searching Like a Boss[edit source]
 Use the Multimedia option to search for images
The built-in Search function is also very powerful. You can use it to find pages, images, categories, templates, and more.

By default, Search results will only include content pages.
Use the Multimedia option to search for images.
Use the Everything option for a quick-and-dirty way to look through all possible results for your search term.
Use the Advanced option to filter your search to specific namespaces, like Category or Template.

Categories[edit source]
 Example of a Category
A Category is exactly what you'd expect: a page that collects all the pages that have been added to that Category. 

Browsing Categories[edit source]
The Everything search option includes Categories in the search results. You can also find them on the Special:Categories page. Categories can prove useful when looking for a specific image or page, particularly when you don't know the exact name of the thing you're looking for.

Adding a Page to a Category[edit source]
 Adding Categories in the Visual Editor
Categories are only useful when pages are actually added to them. This is handled automatically when using certain Page Creation Templates, but in many cases, you'll want to manually add pages to additional categories.
For example, Absolute's Warboard was automatically added to the Shields and Uncommon Items categories by the EquipmentPage template, but also manually added to the Absolute Equipment category to group it with closely related items.
To add a page to a category:

When using the Visual Editor, you can add a page to a category by clicking on the upper-right menu and selecting Categories. Start typing a category name in the provided box, and the editor will suggest autocomplete options for the category, if any exist.
When using the Source Editor, use the markup [[Category:Name of Category Here]] anywhere on the page (typically near the top or bottom, for organizational purposes) to add that page to a category. You can repeat this as many times as needed for additional categories.

How to Upload Images[edit source]
 Uploading a file
If you can't locate an image you need, it may not be uploaded to the wiki yet. In this case, you can upload an image from your computer using the Upload File function from the left-hand navigation toolbar.
Some guidelines to keep in mind when uploading images:

Licensing: Avoid uploading images from other websites, as the licensing for these images may be incompatible with the CC BY-NC-SA license used by bg3.wiki.
File formats: Use .png or .webp for icons, tooltips, and other illustrative images. The .jpg format is ideal for larger game screenshots. Animated .gif files should be used sparingly, generally only when an animated demonstration will add explanatory value to a page.
Compression: It's recommended to compress large files, both to conserve space and to improve page loading times for wiki readers.

Categories: Just like regular pages, you can and should edit an image to add it to one or more categories. This can greatly help other contributors find the image in the future.
Templates[edit source]
A Template is a special type of page designed to be included within other pages. Templates are often used as 'shorthand' to automatically insert frequently-used images, code, and formatting on a page. We use templates extensively on bg3.wiki.
See the Template Quick Reference for an overview of the most commonly-used templates, or continue reading for examples of various templates.
Templates are powerful tools and can become very complex. For a much more in-depth look into templates, see MediaWiki Help:Templates.

Page Creation Templates[edit source]
We use templates like WeaponPage to maintain a clean, consistent style across a large number of pages that share similar properties, such as Spells, Weapons, and other Equipment. These templates take your input in the form of standard parameters and use it to generate a pre-formatted page, optimise the page for search engines and embedded social media links, and add the page to the appropriate categories.
Examples:

Worgfang and Everburn Blade were created using Template:WeaponPage
The Jolty Vest and The Amulet of Lost Voices were created using Template:EquipmentPage
Potion of Speed, Smokepowder Satchel, and Necromancy of Thay were created using Template:MiscItemPage
Another great benefit of this approach is that it allows us to populate database tables with the provided information. For example, every time you add a new item to the wiki using the appropriate page template, it automatically adds the item to a database table which can be queried from elsewhere. This is, for example, how the lists on weapon type pages like Longswords are generated.

Data Querying Templates[edit source]
When information is added to the wiki using an appropriate page creation template, the information is also made available in a database table. These tables can be queried from other pages, to display the data there as well, instead of having to link the user to the original page, or having to copy-paste the content.
For example, when you visit the page of a spell that inflicts Bleeding, you want to see the effects of the condition right then and there, instead of having to navigate to another page. If we copy-pasted the description of the condition into every page that mentions it, we would have a lot of work to do if a patch for the game changed how the condition works! For this reason, the condition is defined once, using the Condition Page template, and other pages query the data to display it.
Writing these queries can be quite complicated. So, the wiki offers templates that do the heavy lifting for you. A primary example is the Condition template, which you provide with the name of a condition, and it queries the data for you, displaying the effects of that condition in a nice format.

Other Templates[edit source]
Other templates can be used in a more focused fashion to insert frequently used, pre-formatted information or to add visual flair to a page, such as {{MediumArmour}} ( Medium Armour) or {{action|bonus}} ( Bonus Action). These types of templates are often embedded within other, larger templates like Page Creation Templates, but they can and should also be used on their own where appropriate.
Additional template examples:

Template:CharacterInfo can generate character infoboxes for Companions, NPCs, and other creatures.
Template:Ability and Template:Class can add formatted Ability Scores and Classes, like so:
 Strength,  Cleric
Using Templates[edit source]
Add a Template to a Page[edit source]
 Inserting a template with the Visual Editor
When using the Visual Editor, select Insert > Template from the toolbar and start typing a template name. The visual editor may not always display documentation for the template or its parameters, so be sure to open the template's page for usage information.
When using the Source Editor, you can either copy and paste template code from an existing page, or newly invoke a template you're already familiar with by enclosing the template name in {{double curly braces}}. For example:
Code: This attack has {{Advantage}}
Result: This attack has  Advantage
Template Parameters[edit source]
Some templates have optional or required parameters that change the output of the template, giving it more versatility.
When invoking a template with parameters, separate each parameter with a pipe symbol |.

Template with one parameter:
Code: {{enchantment|+1}}
Result:  Enchantment: + 1
Template with multiple parameters:
Code: {{Resistances|Slashing=Resistant|Fire=Immune|Cold=Vulnerable}}
Result:

Resistances
 SlashingResistant ColdVulnerable FireImmune
Template Documentation[edit source]
Template creators are encouraged to document (on the template's page itself as well as via the TemplateData button on the same page) how to use that template, including usage examples and accepted values for any template parameters. If you're unfamiliar with a particular template, navigate to its page to learn how it works. If a template page does not show any usage instructions, it could still be a work in progress, and you may want to check with its creator before using it.
See All Pages (Template namespace) for a full list of available templates on bg3.wiki.

More Template Examples[edit source]
The {{DamageInfo}} and {{DamageText}} templates can insert pre-formatted damage information based on the parameters you provide, like so:
{{DamageInfo|2d6+1|Slashing|modifier=melee}} displays  2d6 + 1 (3~13) + Strength Modifier  Slashing 
{{DamageText|1d4|Fire}} displays 1d4Fire, better for compact or inline usage
The {{Icon}} and {{SmallIcon}} templates help you add an icon to represent a spell or item, like so:
{{Icon|Chain Mail Icon.png}} [[Chain Mail]] displays  Chain Mail
{{SmallIcon|Magic Missile Icon.png}} [[Magic Missile]] displays  Magic Missile, better for compact or inline usage

Armour Class - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Armour Class

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki
(Redirected from Armor Class)

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Armour Class (or AC) is what protects a creature from being hit by attacks. Increasing your  Armour Class makes it more difficult for enemies to hit you. AC can be increased by equipping Armour and Shields or by selecting certain Feats when leveling up.

Determining your base Armour Class: 10 (Natural Armour Class) + Dexterity Modifier
The AC bonus from your Dexterity Modifier may be capped when wearing heavier types of Armour.
In order to successfully hit an enemy, your Attack Roll must have a number equal to or greater than than the number of the target's Armour Class.

Proficiency Bonus - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Proficiency Bonus

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see Die Rolls.  For other applications of Proficiency in the game, see Proficiency.
The Proficiency Bonus is a modifier applied to various Die Rolls based on the total Level of a creature (e.g, a Level 2 Monk/Level 3 Barbarian character will have a total level of 5). It can affect Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Skill Checks, if the creature has the correct type of Proficiency for the situation. It doesn't apply to Damage Rolls.

Contents

1.1 Attack Roll
1.2 Saving Throw
1.3 Skill Check

2 Value

When Proficiency Bonus Is Applied[edit | edit source]
Attack Roll[edit | edit source]
For Attack Rolls using a Weapon, the creature must have Proficiency with the weapon it's using to make the attack.
For example, since a Fighter has Proficiency in all Simple Weapons and Martial Weapons, the Proficiency Bonus will be added to all melee and ranged weapon attacks.
On the other hand, a Wizard normally only has Proficiency in Daggers, Quarterstaves, and Light Crossbows, so the Proficiency Bonus won't be added to attacks made with any other weapon, unless the Wizard has Proficiency in that weapon for some other reason.
For spells that require an Attack Roll to hit, the Proficiency Bonus is added if the creature has the innate ability to cast spells. (Note: As of Early Access Patch 9, all classes receive their Proficiency Bonus when casting a spell from a Scroll or other item, even when not innately able to cast spells.)

Saving Throw[edit | edit source]
Saving Throws are categorized by Ability Score, such as Strength Saving Throw, Dexterity Saving Throw, and so on.  For the Proficiency Bonus to be applied to a Saving Throw, the creature must have Proficiency in the corresponding type of Saving Throw.  Each Class provides two Saving Throw Proficiencies.  For example, the Fighter has Proficiency in Strength and Constitution Saving Throws, whereas the Wizard has Proficiency in Intelligence and Wisdom Saving Throws.

Skill Check[edit | edit source]
An Ability Check that is based on a Skill such as Athletics, Perception, or Sleight of Hand, is called a Skill Check.  If a creature has Proficiency in the corresponding Skill, its Proficiency Bonus will be added to the roll.

Value[edit | edit source]
Following is the value of the Proficiency Bonus, based on the total Level of the creature making the roll:

Advantage - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Advantage

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see: Die Rolls
 Advantage and  Disadvantage are a gameplay mechanic that can greatly affect the success of dice rolls.  They can apply to Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Ability Checks, but not to Damage Rolls.

Advantage[edit | edit source]
When you roll with  Advantage, you perform the roll twice, and use the higher result.  You can only have Advantage once; in other words, you'll never roll more than twice for a single attack or check due to Advantage.
Example: You roll two  D20 for an Attack Roll, because you have Advantage.  The results are 16 and 4.  Your effective result is 16.
Advantage is negated by Disadvantage.  The number of Advantages and Disadvantages you have is irrelevant.  Even if you have three sources of Advantage, a single source of Disadvantage will negate it.
Examples of situations that grant Advantage:

Attacking an enemy that is Restrained
Being unseen by the enemy while making an attack
Various spells and abilities that grant Advantage
Disadvantage[edit | edit source]
When you roll with  Disadvantage, you perform the roll twice, and use the lower result.  You can only have Disadvantage once; in other words, you'll never roll more than twice for a single attack or check due to Disadvantage.
Example: You roll two  D20 for an Attack Roll, because you have Disadvantage.  The results are 16 and 4.  Your effective result is 4.
Disadvantage is negated by Advantage.  The number of Advantages and Disadvantages you have is irrelevant.  Even if you have three sources of Disadvantage, a single source of Advantage will negate it.
Examples of situations that grant Disadvantage:

Trying to make a ranged attack against an enemy that is within 5ft of you
Trying to attack an enemy obscured by darkness
Various spells and abilities that grant Disadvantage

When you have a certain Proficiency, you gain Proficiency Bonus on corresponding rolls.  The bonus added to the roll depends on your character's level.

Spells

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Spells are magical energies from the multiverse conjured by spellcasters (Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid, Warlock, etc.) through experience, knowledge, or innate ability to create magical Effects, deal damage to enemies, or heal their allies. 
See: List of all spells
All spellcasters are proficient with Spell Attacks. When they make an Attack Roll with a Spell, they roll against the target's Armour Class (or AC):

 D20 + Proficiency Bonus + Spellcasting Ability Modifier
Spells which do not invoke an Attack Roll often require the target to roll a Saving Throw against the spellcaster's spellcasting Difficulty Class (or DC):

Spell Slots[edit | edit source]
Spell Slots are the spellcasters' Resource used to cast Spells. Once Spell Slots are depleted, they can only be regained through a Long Rest, with the following notable exceptions:

Certain classes like Wizard and some Druid subclasses have the ability to regain a small number of Spell Slots once per Long Rest.
Warlocks only need to take a Short Rest to fully regain their Spell Slots.
Spell Slot Levels[edit | edit source]
Each Spell Slot has a level that corresponds to the level of spells that can be cast using that slot:  Level 1,  Level 2,  Level 3, and so on.
Cantrips  do not consume any spell slots and are effectively an infinite resource.
Due to their unique mechanics, the spell slots of a Warlock are colored differently, like so: 

Upcasting[edit | edit source]
Upcasting refers to when a spellcaster chooses to use a higher level spell slot to cast a lower level spell. Many spells gain additional damage dice, area of effect, targets, or other effects when upcast, but some spells gain no additional benefit. Warlock spells are always upcast to their highest known spell level.

The total amount of spell slots a spellcaster would get is dependent upon their Effective Spellcaster Level (ESL). For full spellcasters ( Bards,  Clerics,  Druids,  Sorcerers, and  Wizards) this is exactly their class level (A level 5 wizard has an Effective Spellcaster Level of 5); "Half-spellcasters" ( Rangers and  Paladins), are not considered spellcasters until class level 2, at which point their Effective Spellcaster Level is their class level halved. "One-third-spellcasters"  ( Arcane Trickster Rogues and  Eldritch Knight Fighters) are all subclasses that can only be taken at class level three, their Effective Spellcaster Level is their class level divided by three. For the purpose of determining Spell Slot Distribution the Effective Spellcaster Level is rounded up.
Once the Effective Spellcaster Level is known, one can consult the following table to find out their character's spell slot distribution: 
The number of spell slot for each level across ESL has no clear pattern, but when a spell level opens up does have an identifiable pattern. The maximum spell level a spellcaster has access to is their ESL halved and then rounded up.
 Warlocks are unique in this regard, their spell slots are all of a uniform level, matching the highest spell slot available of a normal full spellcaster class until spell level 5, which is the highest level spell slot warlocks can have. They also simply gain a spell slot at class level 1,2, and 11.

Concentration[edit | edit source]
Main page: Concentration
 Concentration is another type of resource a spellcaster has. Certain spells require the caster to continuously put focus into the spell in order to maintain its effects, such spells are called  Concentration spells, and this requirement will be clearly labeled with the  Concentration tag in the spell's description. The caster may still do other actions while concentrating, but are at risk of losing said concentration under certain circumstances. If the caster loses Concentration, the spell ends prematurely. A caster can only concentrate on one spell at a time, said spell will be shown on top of/next to the caster's portrait.
When the caster takes damage, they must make a Constitution Saving Throw ( D20 + Constitution Modifier) to maintain Concentration. The result must match or exceed a DC of 10 or half the number of damage they received, whichever is higher.

Ways you can lose Concentration while maintaining Concentration Spells:
Failing a Concentration Check by taking damage.
Casting another Concentration Spell.
Being affected by Conditions such as Downed, Sleeping, Rage, etc.
Voluntarily ending the concentration effect. (This is done by clicking the x button on the concentrated spell's icon on top of/next to the caster's portrait)
Spellcasting Ability and Proficiency[edit | edit source]
Every class, even non-spellcasters, has an ability specifically designated to represent their ability to cast spells. This ability would be that class's Spellcasting Ability, the Ability Score Modifier of said Spellcasting Ability is directly added to the difficulty for which the spellcaster's targets face when trying to mitigate the effects of most spells from said spellcaster. This added difficulty-to-resist is more simply known as the spellcaster's Spellcasting Ability Modifier.
Non-spellcasters typically only cast spells by using magical items (which include scrolls), however, they are not considered Proficient spellcasters. Whereas actual Spellcasters are considered Proficient at spellcasting, whether with learned spells or magical items. Spellcasting Proficiency has similar function to Spellcasting Ability Modifier.
For more details, see the Saving Throw and Attack Roll pages for a comprehensive explanation of how the Spellcasting Ability Modifier and Spellcasting Proficiency is applied.
Each class uses a different Ability Score Modifier for spellcasting:

 Intelligence (INT):  Wizards,  Fighters*†, and  Rogues*†.
 Wisdom (WIS):  Clerics,  Rangers,  Druids, and  Monks*.
 Charisma (CHA): Bards,  Paladins,  Sorcerers,  Warlocks, and  Barbarians*.
*Non-spellcasters
†These classes, while normally non-spellcasters, have the option of becoming spellcasters by specializing into specific subclasses ( Arcane Trickster Rogues and  Eldritch Knight Fighters)

NB: Occasionally, specific spells will designate its own Spellcasting Ability regardless of the class in question, this is most commonly a result of spells obtained via racial features.

Prepared Spells[edit | edit source]
Prepared Spells are Spells that must be prepared beforehand in order to be cast, this can only be done outside of combat. Spellcasters that primarily utilizes this type of spells are known as Prepared Spellcasters. This includes:

 Cleric
 Druid
 Paladin
 Wizard
These spellcasters will need to anticipate which spells would be useful in advance. In exchange, these classes will have access to every class-level-appropriate spell in their Spell List.
Uniquely, Wizards are prepared casters that can only choose a subset of eligible spells to be learnt on leveling up, but are allowed to learn more spells by transcribing scrolls.
The number of Prepared Spells each class can have at a time is equal to (Spellcasting Ability Modifier + Class Level) (Minimum of 1)
For this purpose a Paladin's class level is halved and rounded down.

Known Spells[edit | edit source]
Known Spells are spells permanently memorized by a spellcaster, meaning these Spells are functionally Always Prepared. Spellcasters that primarily utilizes this type of spells are known as Spontaneous Spellcasters. This includes:

 Arcane Trickster Rogue
 Bard
 Eldritch Knight Fighter
 Ranger
 Sorcerer
 Warlock
These spellcasters will not need to worry about spell preparation. In exchange, they can only learn a subset of their class's Spell List.
Spontaneous Spellcasters have access to the Replacement Spell feature, which allows them to swap a known spell each time they level up.
Additionally, Spells granted by Races or by certain Subclasses (such as Cleric Domains) are considered "inherent" and is Always Prepared. This happens even if the character in question has a class that is normally is a Prepared Spellcaster.

Ritual Spells[edit | edit source]
Ritual spells are a special type of spell. When a Ritual Spell is cast outside of combat, they do not consume spell slots and are effectively free to cast. They consume spell slots as normal in-combat.
Ritual spells include:
Detect Thoughts
Disguise Self
Enhance Leap
Feather Fall
Find Familiar
Longstrider
Silence
Speak with Animals

Inspiration is a game mechanic in Baldur's Gate 3. Inspiration can be used to reroll a failed Ability Check.
You may have up to 4 Inspiration Points at a time.
Inspiration is shared between all characters, so you have a maximum of 4 inspirations for the whole party not per character, and if one character gains inspiration it is added to the pool so another can use it.

Gaining Inspiration[edit | edit source]
Inspiration Points can be gained by completing specific actions that reflect your character's Background.
See each individual background's page for a list of Inspiration-granting actions:

Acolyte (Shadowheart and custom origin characters)
Charlatan (Astarion and custom origin characters)
Criminal
Entertainer
Folk Hero (Wyll and custom origin characters)
Guild Artisan
Haunted One (The Dark Urge only)
Noble (Minthara and custom origin characters)
Outlander (Karlach and custom origin characters)
Sage (Gale and custom origin characters)
Soldier (Lae'zel and custom origin characters)

Gameplay[edit | edit source]
As a Fighter, Lae'zel should be at the forefront of most combat situations. At level 1, she comes with the two-handed Fighting Style Great Weapon Fighting. She is capable of withstanding heavy damage and dealing heavy damage back to enemies in return. A Githyanki, she has access to several very useful mobility spells as she levels, including Mage Hand, Enhance Leap, and eventually Misty Step. At level 3, Lae'zel gains a Fighter subclass which allows her to broaden her list of martial abilities or diverge into something different, such as enhancing her combat abilities with spellcasting.

Recruitment[edit | edit source]
Main recruitment[edit | edit source]
Lae'zel can be recruited in Chapter One.

Lae'zel is first encountered on the Nautiloid during the Prologue. While escaping from the nautiloid, she joins the party as a temporary companion. She leaves the party after successfully escaping.
Lae'zel is encountered again a second time in the Wilderness. She has been captured in a wooden cage by two Tieflings, Damays and Nymessa. If the player is able to free her, she can be invited to join the party.
Alternative recruitment opportunities[edit | edit source]
If she dies during the Tutorial level, her body will be found at the beach starting area. Using a scroll of Revivify on her will bring her back to live and players can recruit her.
If players progress further to the Grove and trigger the scene at the gates, she will break out of her cage and disappear, killing Damays and Nymessa if they are still alive. She can then be found later on and be recruitable again.
After breaking out of the cage, or if players refused her joining up with them until this point, she will show up when players encounter the Githyanki near the Mountain Pass. Players have another chance to recruit her there if she doesn't turn hostile during the encounter. If she does during it as an ally or neutral, she can be resurrected and still join.
If players miss all the recruitment opportunities above, or refuse her in them, she can be found again one final time near the first waypoint in the region where the Crèche is located for a final recruitment opportunity.
Recruitment cut off point[edit | edit source]

  Spoiler warning! This section reveals details about the story of Baldur's Gate 3.

If players proceed inside the Crèche without recruiting Laezel either in party or in camp, she will be missing from the mountain pass. If players proceed to the shadowcursed lands, they will find her as an undead there, permanently dead. She went the wrong way when trying to find the Crèche.

Background[edit | edit source]
Lae'zel is a Githyanki Warrior from Crèche K'liir, a githyanki enclave on an asteroid near Selûne, the moon of Faerûn. Before the events of Baldur's Gate 3, Lae'zel was captured by Mind Flayers. After being abducted, she is encountered by the player on the Nautiloid. They join forces in order to commandeer the Nautiloids transponder and escape.

Personality[edit | edit source]
Lae'zel is depicted as xenophobic, arrogant, and quick to anger. She is proud of Githyanki, and frequently makes comments to the party detailing Githyanki customs and the nature of her people. In her mission to remove her Mind Flayer parasite, she does not hesitate to intimidate or harm those who would step in her way. She also approves of evil-aligned actions from the player, such as betraying Astarion to a vampire hunter. She is fiercely loyal to Vlaakith, the queen of all Githyanki. 

Interactions[edit | edit source]
Approval[edit | edit source]
Lae'zel favors direct approaches and is not interested in wasting any time in finding a solution to the Tadpole infection.
The following story and dialogue choices will cause Lae'zel to gain approval.

Act 1
In camp on the first night, after speaking with her first, talk to Shadowheart and say you agree with her.
Persuade Kagha to free Arabella.

Take the [Half-Drow] option when encountering the githyanki search party to say that you speak for her, interrupting her.
Let Astarion kill the Gur monster hunter Gandrel while she is in the party.

Romance[edit | edit source]
Can romance players of any sex and race.
The following section explains Lae'zel's romance.

  Spoiler warning! This section reveals details about the story of Baldur's Gate 3.

During the Party, regardless of side or approval, Lae'zel's first important romance scene can happen. She will commend the player's martial prowess and offer intercourse - no strings attached. If the player agrees, they will later encounter her inside the altar room, naked. Lae'zel will then demand the player to submit, where they can either comply or success an Intimidation roll to make Lae'zel submit instead. A rough sexual scene will then happen.
Regardless of who takes charge, the player will wake up next morning - in pain. Lae'zel will insist it was just for pleasure and might or might not lay with the player again.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Lae'zel is voiced by Devora Wilde.

Chapter Two - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Chapter Two

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
This page was last confirmed to be up-to-date at:  2023-08-09  
Chapter Two of Baldur's Gate 3 (sometimes referred to as Act 2) takes place after Chapter One as the player enters the Shadow-Cursed Lands to reach Moonrise Towers.
Contents

1 Point of No Return
2 Locations
3 Companions
4 Main Quest
5 Side Quests

Point of No Return[edit | edit source]
The exact delineation between Chapter One and Chapter Two can be somewhat confusing for new players as entering the Shadow-Cursed Lands from either the Mountain Pass or the Underdark will trigger an alert reminding the player to tie up any loose ends before proceeding. Despite this, the player will still able to return to the Wilderness and complete the majority of lingering quests at any point. The point of no return in Chapter Two takes place much later, inside the Temple of Shar. Another alert will trigger, and after this point it becomes impossible to return to the Wilderness, all of the Wilderness waypoints will be inaccessible, and all incomplete quests from the Wilderness will automatically close.

Locations[edit | edit source]
Shadow-Cursed Lands
Moonrise Towers
Companions[edit | edit source]
Three additional companions can be recruited in Chapter Two if they survived the events of Chapter One and the player completes their requisite quests.

Minthara (Decide Minthara's Fate)
Halsin
Jaheira
Main Quest[edit | edit source]

This section is a stub. You can help Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki by expanding it.See the guide on how to contribute.

Origin - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Origin

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki
(Redirected from Origins)

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
The player avatar's Origin is what defines their previous history and relation to the world around them. 
Picking an Origin is the first choice in Character Creation when starting a new game. The player can choose to create a completely custom character, or choose from one of 7 Origin Characters, each which has their own unique stories, desires, and attitudes toward the world around them.
If not chosen as the player avatar, each Origin Character (except The Dark Urge) appears in the game world as companions, who the player may choose to recruit into their party throughout their journey.
Once the correct NPC is discovered, the player and origin companions may change their class and attributes.  Note, Backgrounds cannot be changed.

8 The Dark Urge

Custom[edit | edit source]
Create a completely custom character.

You’ve always felt you had a greater calling, but it has never borne fruit. Everything changes when you awaken imprisoned on an alien ship. Perhaps your time has finally come.

Astarion[edit | edit source]
Play as Astarion the Rogue.

Astarion prowled the night as a vampire spawn for centuries, forced to follow the orders of his sadistic master, Cazador: seduce every fool with a pulse, and lure them back to Cazador's lair. Free for now, Astarion will do anything to keep his life in the light. He can see but one way to ensure his liberty for good: become many times more powerful than his old abuser could ever dream of being. 
His body is forever tainted by the intricate, patterned scarring Cazador carved upon his back, and the elder vampire seems set on sending out waves of hunters seeking to capture his lost spawn.

Gale[edit | edit source]
Play as Gale the Wizard.

What’s a god to a world-class wizard? Gale was once a formidable archmage in Waterdeep, but pushed his relationship with the goddess Mystra too far. Failing to usurp his former lover’s godhood, the goddess stole Gale’s magics away and cursed him with the Netherese Orb, a dangerous artefact with enough magical potential energy in it to level a city if it were allowed to escape.
Beyond learning the lesson for his hubris, Gale has now become beset with concern for the danger he poses to others around him, and is worried that if he undergoes ceremorphosis, the angry Orb could imperil countless lives if he can’t neutralise it first.

Karlach[edit | edit source]
Play as Karlach the Barbarian.

Fresh-escaped from Hell, Karlach is finally free of the archdevil Zariel - but not from the infernal engine Zariel planted in her chest. With her first taste of freedom in ten years, Karlach is eager to find a fix for the engine that's burning hotter and hotter before it burns her out completely. But even more premier in her mind? Exploring, finding like-minded travellers, falling in love (or lust)... and taking revenge on the man who sold her to Zariel all those years ago.

Lae'zel[edit | edit source]
Play as Lae'zel the Fighter.

Crashed down to the Sword Coast from the stars, Lae'zel is a fierce warrior, even by the standards of militant githyanki society. When faced with the possibility of becoming a mind flayer, the monster she has dedicated her life to defeating, she must prove her worth and earn the right to rejoin her people -- if they don't execute her first. Will Lae'zel's strength and determination be enough to prove herself to Queen Vlaakith, or must she walk another path in exile?

Shadowheart[edit | edit source]
Play as Shadowheart the Cleric.

A devoted cleric of Shar, goddess of darkness and loss, Shadowheart agreed to have her memories wiped as part of a holy mission. Now its sole survivor, she must deliver a powerful relic back to her kin in order to win Shar's love and have her memories restored – but all the while, she is tormented by strange, painful magic that she struggles to understand.

Wyll[edit | edit source]
Play as Wyll the Warlock.

From a scion of a famed Baldurian house to a life of adventure on the road, Wyll’s life as the monster hunter called the Blade of Frontiers has made him one of the beating hearts of the Sword Coast. While he has done great deeds for the Coast’s people, the source of his power remains secret. The cambion Mizora drew Wyll into a warlock’s pact in a moment with many lives at stake, and cursed him with the duty of hunting her enemies. Mizora only asks Wyll to sacrifice devilish creatures to her, but a cambion’s ambitions are ever fickle, and Wyll wishes to escape the pact before its price grows cruel.

The Dark Urge[edit | edit source]
Play a custom character with the The Dark Urge.

You remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a path paved with blood. As you venture on, you find yourself inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties. Where do these thoughts come from?

Prologue - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Prologue

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search

The first major quest of Baldur's Gate 3, Escape the Nautiloid, takes place immediately after the opening cinematic. The main character, now infected with a Mind Flayer tadpole, is aboard the ship the Nautiloid when it is attacked by Githyanki warriors. While trying to escape the attacking githyanki, the mind flayer controlling the ship warps it through different planes of existence, ending up in Avernus, the first of the Nine Hells. The objective of the Prologue is to find a way out of the Nautiloid, ideally not by dropping down into Hell.

Contents

1 Objectives
2 Walkthrough

2.1 Nursery room
2.2 Brain room

2.2.1 The Intellect Devourer

2.3 Meeting Lae'zel
2.4 Shadowheart room
2.5 Ceremorphosis room
2.6 Helm of the Nautiloid
2.7 The Crash

Objectives[edit | edit source]
Find a way off the Nautiloid.
We've been abducted by mind flayers and infected with some kind of parasite. We need to find a way off this ship.
Reach the Helm.
We met one of the mind flayer's minions - an intellect devourer. It wants us to go to the helm of the ship.
(Alternatively if Us is skipped or destroyed) We met a githyanki named Lae'zel. She told us we can escape if we reach the ship's helm.
Connect the nerves of the transponder.
The mind flayer told us we need to connect the nerves of the transponder to escape Hell.
We escaped Hell on the Nautiloid.
Walkthrough[edit | edit source]
Hint: This walkthrough makes extensive use of compass directions (north, south, east, west). Disabling the option Rotating minimap under the User Interface settings may make it easier to follow these directions.

Nursery room[edit | edit source]
 Nursery room
This is the room in which the game begins. The main character has broken free from a Mind Flayer Pod and is standing alone in the room. Around the room there are various empty mind flayer pods indicating that there might be other survivors.
1. In the middle of the room there is a mind flayer "nursery" i.e. a pool filled with larvae. Upon interacting with it, you can Investigate it to determine that it's about to break apart. If you try to touch it, it explodes and causes a small amount of damage to your character. To the south of the nursery there is a dead mind flayer you can loot for a random gem.
2. Further south you can climb up to a small elevation in the room, where a Cartilaginous Chest can be looted for some random loot including gold.
3. To the east of the room, slightly southward, you can go up to a larger elevated area, circling around all the way to the northwest of the room. Along this elevated area you can find:

An Onyx and a Rune Slate lying on a table. Interacting the slate confers visions of the nautiloid ship.
A Cartilaginous Chest containing some gold.
On the west side of the room you will find an illithid restoration device that fully heals you upon interaction, and a door to the next room.

Brain room[edit | edit source]
 Brain room
1. In the northeast there is a table with an Illithid Record and a Goblin corpse with a little gold. The record can be interacted with to reveal that it contains knowledge about Goblin culture.
2. West of the goblin there is a table with three further rune slates, which give further insight about the nautiloid and a comment about an anomaly, likely referring to the player character.
2. Westwards and to the north of the room there is a table on which you can find an Eldritch Tablet. The tablet can be interacted with just like the illithid record. The tablet contains knowledge about humanoid history (elves, dwarves, humans, etc.).
3. In the middle of the room, a small elevator can get you to an upper section of the room. Here you will find a dying person sitting on a chair with their scalp removed, their exposed brain telepathically asking you for help.

The Intellect Devourer[edit | edit source]
When you interact with the person in the chair, your character may be able to notice that the exposed brain is not in fact the person's own brain, but rather an Intellect Devourer named Us by succeeding an Arcana Check. You have various options to try to free the creature from the skull, although you can also just leave it in place or destroy it outright. Should you choose to free it and succeed, it can give you a bit of information about your situation, and will become a temporary Companion who can assist you in battle.
While freeing the intellect devourer from the skull, you also have the option of trying to mutilate it to make it more obedient to you, although this seems to be unnecessary as it's obedient to you either way, and failing the Dexterity Check while trying to mutilate it will cause the creature to go hostile.

Meeting Lae'zel[edit | edit source]
To the west of the brain room there's an opening in the Nautiloid's shell. An outer path leads northwest, where you will have your first encounter with the Githyanki soldier Lae'zel, who was previously seen being infected with a tadpole in the opening cinematic.
As Lae'zel jumps down from a ledge to attack you, the telepathic connection between you caused by the mind flayer larva makes her realize that you're not under mind control, and that the two of you could cooperate. She insists that you go to the helm of the Nautiloid, where you can take control of it, but first you will need to clear the way by battling some imps.

 Imp battle room
In the battle, there are three imps you need to defeat. This is easily done by going on the offense. They drop Scimitar, Handaxe and Light Crossbow.
After the battle, you can loot a dead incinerated Mind Flayer, two imp corpses and four dead thralls for minor loot, including another Handaxe and Light Crossbow as well as Shortsword, Simple Robe and Potion of Healing.
You can exit this room to the northeast, climbing some cliffs. There's a healing pod on the ascent.

Shadowheart room[edit | edit source]
In this room you will be greeted by a pair of knocked out cultists on chairs, and some sort of control panel with three pairs of sigils and buttons. Lae'zel will warn you not to touch anything.

 Shadowheart room
1. You will also hear a woman trapped in a mind flayer pod thudding against its glass encasing. It's Shadowheart, who will suggest you try to use the contraption next to the pod to get it opened. Looking at said contraption will reveal that there is an empty socket of some sort. You need an object to fit in there (see the next section). Aside Shadowheart's pod, there is a backpack with gold and a random gem.
2. To the south, there's a table with various objects on it: a Burnished Necklace, Dark Mind (a brain in a jar), the Illithid Manuscript, which seems to tell a story about "a brain, a githyanki warrior, and centuries of darkness", and a locked Elaborate Reliquary. You might be able to pick the lock of the reliquary, otherwise you can look for the key (see below). It contains gold and an Onyx.
3. Going back towards the entrance, you can look at the sigils on the control panel. Each will trigger an Arcana Check to allow you to read it. The left one says "Unleash," the middle one "Aggression," and the right one "Annihilate". The Unleash button apparently makes psionic energy radiate from the two knocked out cultists, but it's unclear what use this has (It does not allow you to talk to them. This might be just unimplemented yet). The Aggression button will make them become hostile against you. Annihilate will kill them. Making them attack you and then defeating them gives you 1 XP each if you're into that. Looting them can also be done by just pressing Annihilate.
You might notice that an intellect devourer occasionally walks through this room. The intellect devourer won't drop any loot if it is killed.
If you weren't able to lockpick the reliquary containing the Eldritch Rune for Shadowheart's pod, you'll want to look into the room to the east to find the key. To the south, in turn, you can finally enter the helm.

Ceremorphosis room[edit | edit source]
 Ceremorphosis room
At the entrance of the room lies a dead thrall on which you can find the key to the reliquary in the previous room.
There is yet another mind flayer pod at the center. This one contains a dazed woman who seems unresponsive. Behind her is a console with a sigil and a button. The sigil yet again triggers an arcana check, and succeeding it reveals that it says "Perfect". Pushing it makes the woman in the pod become a mind flayer.
On a raised platform at the back of the room there is a cartilaginous chest with 2 Potions of Healing and another dead thrall with an Eldritch Rune, that can be inserted into the control panel of Shadowheart's pod back in the other room to free her.
There's nowhere to go from this room but back to the previous, so at this point you can go back and south, to free Shadowheart and/or go to the helm to the south.

If you are a Warlock, Wizard or Sorcerer, you can free her without using the rune by passing an Arcana Check on the machine.
If you are a Barbarian, you can free her without using the rune by passing a Strength Check on the pod.
With Lae'zel as a companion, Shadowheart will be a little snarky, but either way she asks to join you as a companion.

Helm of the Nautiloid[edit | edit source]
As you enter the helm, you will see a mind flayer fighting Commander Zhalk, a powerful Cambion wielding a flaming greatsword.  A cutscene will play in which the mind flayer orders you to connect the nerves of the transponder, referring to the control apparatus of the ship that allows it to travel between dimensions.  The mind flayer thinks that you're a thrall, thus considers you an ally.

 The helm
A pair of lesser imps and a Lesser Hellsboar will block your path, but they should be easy to defeat if you have both Lae'zel and Shadowheart as companions. One of the imps carries a Light Crossbow, the other a Scimitar.
There are also lots of dead bodies on the floor, though none contain any notable loot. A dead thrall can be looted for a Leather Armour and Shortsword, imps for a Light Crossbow, Handaxe, Dagger and two more thralls for Shortswords. Two mindflayer corpses yield random gems.
Dotted around the room are 3 caustic and 4 void bulbs, lying on tables (some in an upper area of the room), but it's probably not worth chasing after them. There are some Mucoid Shells and a Sodalite Shell as well.
While all the cutscenes and dialogue in this scene of the game tell you to ignore Commander Zhalk and reach the console, it's actually possible to help the mind flayer kill him. This gives you a large XP boost, and he will drop the greatsword Everburn Blade.
Don't take too long though, as a pair of Cambion soldiers will enter the room to join the fight at some point. They are almost as powerful as Commander Zhalk himself, so if they defeat the mind flayer and start attacking you, the battle will become nigh impossible. Although killing them might give you another big XP boost, this is almost certainly not worth the effort.
There is one plausible strategy for milking out even more XP from this room though, and that's killing Zhalk (along with all the minor minions in the room) just before the other two cambions appear.  This makes the mind flayer go hostile against you, saying "you are no longer needed," and you have to be careful not to be immediately killed by it.  If you get the timing just right, the two cambions should arrive right after that, after which the flayer will focus on them instead.  The cambions will easily kill it, providing your party XP as the killed flayer was a hostile.  (If the cambions arrive before Zhalk dies, the flayer doesn't turn hostile, thus its death doesn't provide you with XP.)
Note that nearing the console also makes another two lesser imps and another lesser hellsboar appear, though these should be easy to kill or even just run past.  (If you've already milked Zhalk and the flayer for XP, you really don't need these minor guys on top of all that.)  Once you've reached the console, interact with it to start a cutscene and end the prologue.

The Crash[edit | edit source]
In the cutscene that follows, the character that interacted with the neural console connects two arms to make the ship warp out of Avernus and back into the Prime Material Plane, but moments before the warp a red dragon latches on to the ship and breathes fire onto the console.
As the ship appears in the sky of the Material Plane, a Tiefling behind a telescope (Nadira) is seen looking at it with worry, and in another place, a Hobgoblin (Dror Ragzlin) and a rather smug-looking Drow (Minthara) observe the ship's descent. They order a group of goblins to march out of some sort of fort they seem to be occupying.
Back in the crashing Nautiloid, our main character is trying to hold on, but is hit in the face by a piece of debris and sent flying out of the Nautiloid. As the character falls to the ground, moments before impact they are held mid-air by magical force and end up having a soft landing.  There is nobody nearby, indicating that this might be the doing of the mind flayer larva lodged behind the character's eye.

Skills - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Skills

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Skills refer to certain kinds of talents a creature can be Proficient in, to gain a Proficiency Bonus on the corresponding type of Skill Check.  Each Skill is also related to an Ability Score, which determines the Ability Score Modifier applied to that Skill Check regardless of Proficiency.  To get a full picture of how Skills are involved in rolls, you may want to go through the Die Rolls page, but here is a brief example:
The Athletics Skill is based on the Strength Ability Score.  This means that when a creature rolls for a Skill Check based on Athletics (in other words, an Athletics Check), it first of all benefits from its Strength Modifier.  If the creature is Proficient in Athletics, it additionally benefits from its Proficiency Bonus, which is unrelated to Ability Scores and is based purely on the creature's Level.

D&D 5e Rule Changes - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

D&D 5e Rule Changes

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
This page was last confirmed to be up-to-date at:  2023-08-07 

This page and related pages summarize rule changes from the implementation of Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition (D&D 5e) rules to Baldur's Gate 3 (BG3).
The rule changes described on this page and related pages are written with the assumption the reader understands the relevant D&D 5e rule. These pages will not explain what the D&D 5e rule is, only what the changed or altered BG3 rule is. These pages also include many BG3 features and abilities that are unchanged from D&D 5e to help a D&D 5e player quickly see which options have changed and which have not, and make decisions without having to do additional research. If the BG3 rule aligns with a OneD&D rule or other playtest material from D&D 5e, that is considered a rule change from D&D 5e.

All races have a +2/+1 flexible ability score bonus - similar to Tasha's alternate rules - though the standard 5e racial ability score bonus and the +1/+1/+1 option do not exist. Half-elves and Humans have been granted additional features to make up for this change.
Multiclassing ignores ability score requirements.
You are able to respec your characters when you meet an NPC made available early in Act 1 of the game. You may respec your starting class, subclass (when applicable), ability scores, spells (when applicable), and skill proficiencies gained from class. It is not possible to change a character's race, background or skill proficiencies gained from either.
If you change an origin companion or traditional companion's starting class (or subclass when applicable), the game will still treat them as members of said class for their Origins-exclusive dialogue. They will gain dialogues from and reactions to their new class as appropriate.
Hit points gained on level are fixed values, not a roll of the hit die.
The party is limited to two short rests per long rest. Short rests restore each ally's hit points by an amount equal to half their maximum HP (rounded down). There is no hit die rolling.
Long rests require camp supplies, which are food items that must be looted or purchased. In towns you will be able to rest at an inn.
Rolling a natural 1 on an ability check always results in failure, even if modifiers would put you over the DC. Rolling a natural 20 on a skill check always results in success, even if modifiers would not put you over the DC. There are no additional fumble or critical success features besides an automatic failure or pass of the ability check.
Combat areas tend to have a large amount of verticality, but are rather small in horizontal size. This has led to the following mechanical changes:
The ranges of spells are reduced as described on the spells page, often to 60 ft.
The normal ranges of ranged weapons are reduced to 60 ft, except hand crossbows, which have a range of 50 ft.
Darkvision is reduced to 40 ft, and Superior Darkvision to 80 ft.
Cover from D&D has not been implemented, but a line of sight to the target is still required.
When a creature is at least 10 ft above their target and makes a ranged attack, they receive a +2 bonus to the attack roll due to high ground. When a creature is at least 10 ft below their target and makes a ranged attack, they receive a -2 penalty to the attack roll due to low ground.
If two player controlled characters are next to each other in the initiative order then their initiative is shared. Both characters can act at the same time.
Tool and language proficiencies are not implemented. This includes Thieves' Tools. Skill checks to pick a lock or disarm a trap use the character's sleight of hand modifier, and require a set of thieves' tools or trap disarm toolkit respectively, which are consumed on a failure.
Rules for sound and hearing is not implemented and NPCs may only detect what they see. If you hide while not in a creature's sight cone, you automatically succeed. If you try to hide while in a creature's sight cone, you automatically fail. If you are hidden and enter a creature's sight cone, you must roll stealth against the creature's passive perception. This may be a straight roll, advantage, or disadvantage, based on the creature's senses and the level of lighting. Some creatures with different senses such as blindsight may follow different rules.
There is an inspiration system. As a party you can have up to 4 inspiration dice which can be applied to a failed skill check. The way you gain dice is based on the background of you and your companions. If for example you or one of your companions have the Charlatan background, they may gain an inspiration die for your party if they deceive their way into a fortified enemy position.
Characters can carry a maximum 10 kg / 20 lbs of weight per point of Str. If the character is carrying an amount of weight equal to 14 lbs (7 kg) x Strength, they are encumbered. This becomes heavily encumbered at 18 lbs (9 kg) × Strength.
Spellcasting[edit | edit source]
See Also: D&D 5e Spell Changes

Prepared spell casters may change their prepared spells at any time out of combat.
Verbal, Somatic, and Material components are ignored. Being silenced prevents all spellcasting regardless of what the components would be in D&D 5e.
The game does not stop a character from casting a leveled spell with both an action and a bonus action.
All caster classes are capable of Ritual casting is not in Early Access, and Ritual Caster feat instead allows the selection of two Ritual Spells.
Anyone can cast any Spell scroll from any class list (even if it is not their own or they do not have the spellcasting feature), and there is no Arcana check for casting higher level spells than a character has spells known.
Spell scrolls do not have a fixed DC or attack roll bonus. They use the caster's relevant casting modifier (verification required at launch when multiclassing implemented).
When multiclassing, Warlock spells cannot be cast using regular spell slots, or vice versa.
Cantrips receive their third upgrade at level 10 in the game, rather than level 11.
Action Economy[edit | edit source]
A character can have one ranged weapon set equipped and one melee weapon set equipped, and are able to freely switch between them as a free action an unlimited number of times per turn. This includes starting their turn with the melee weapon equipped, switching to a crossbow for free, shooting at targets, and switching back to the melee set to allow them to make opportunity attacks. Equipping a weapon from the inventory costs an action.
Shove is not a part of the attack action. It is a bonus action available to all characters. Shove only pushes the target back an amount that depends on the shover's strength and the target's weight. It normally does not knock them prone unless they are shoved off a high ledge.
Falling damage only sometimes causes a creature to go prone.[Needs Verification]
Using the help action on a downed ally brings them back to 1 hit point and leaves them prone.
Jumping is a bonus action which consumes 10 ft of movement speed. With a Strength score of 10 or below, a creature can jump 15 ft, and this increases by 5 ft for every two points in strength above 10. At 20 Str a creature may spend 10 ft of movement speed and a bonus action to jump, and can travel 35 ft effectively increasing the creature's movement speed by up to 25 feet.
The Dodge action is not implemented, with the exception of the monk's Patient Defence ability.
Readying an action is not implemented.
Grappling is not implemented.
Consuming a potion is a bonus action.
If a creature throws a healing potion as an action, it will break and heal all targets in a small radius. This applies to many - but not all - types of Potions.
There are options to throw creatures which are at least one size smaller than you (not always accurately implemented). There is a minimum Strength required, based on the target's weight, and you need to win a contested check using your Athletics.
Bonus action attack options such as offhand weapon attacks do not require a character to first take the attack action.
Donning and doffing armour does not take time, and can be done as an action even in combat.
Equipment[edit | edit source]
Weapons are given unique weapon action attacks depending on the weapon type. These can be used once per short rest only if the wielder is proficient with the weapon.
There is no magic item attunement system.
A creature can have a melee weapon set and a ranged weapon set equipped that they can toggle between freely. If you have a shield equipped in the equipped melee set but have the ranged weapon set being actively wielded, you still benefit from the AC boost the shield provides.
Some equipment like gloves, boots, or helms may require armour proficiency to wear effectively. They don't grant a bonus to armour class (unless they have a magical effect that specifically says so), but may have magical effects and the character will only be able to don them effectively with the correct proficiency.
Heavy armour does not have a Strength requirement, and therefore no movement speed penalty.
You are unable to select starting equipment; you are given starting equipment based on your starting class.
Crossbows currently have the loading property, but it does not restrict the usage of crossbows in any way. It is possible that they will continue to ignore loading at release (needs confirmation).
This allows a character to dual wield hand crossbows. It does not allow a character to wield a hand crossbow with a shield because the crossbow goes in the ranged set while the shield goes in the melee set. But as discussed above, the character gains the AC bonus of a shield equipped on your melee set even while the ranged set is actively drawn.
Appropriate weapons have the "heavy" property added to them, but this property does not apply disadvantage to attack rolls made by small characters.
Slings, darts, and whips are not in the game.
The weights of various pieces of equipment have changed. For example, chain mail weighs 36lbs instead of 55lbs.
Conditions[edit | edit source]
Blinded: In addition to the other effects, ranged attacks are limited to 15 ft range. Blinded creatures can also make opportunity attacks.
Encumbered: A character becomes encumbered when they carry an amount equal to 14 lbs (7 kg) times their Strength rather than 5 times. Being encumbered also halves your jump distance in addition to the normal effects.
Heavily encumbered: A character becomes heavily encumbered at 18 lbs (9 kg) times their Strength rather than 10 times. It also prohibits them from being able to climb or jump at all in addition to the normal effects.
Frightened: Creatures which are frightened are unable to move at all (rather than being unable to move toward the source of their fear), unless the effect instead makes them "fearful" which gives them the frightened effect as well as making them flee.
Prone: Being prone gives disadvantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws, attacks against a prone creature have advantage out to a range of 10 ft rather than 5 ft, and ranged attacks against a prone creature do not have disadvantage. Your character cannot do anything while prone. Starting the turn while prone will cause you to automatically use half your movement to stand up. Becoming prone during your turn automatically ends your turn.
Turned: Turned creatures will not dodge, as it is not implemented as an action.
Wet: This is a new condition that prevents the character from burning (e.g. from Searing Smite) and grants resistance to fire damage, but also makes the creature vulnerable to lightning and cold damage.
Miscellaneous[edit | edit source]
Great Weapon Fighting Style rerolls any and all of an attack's damage dice on a 1 or 2, even if they are not a part of the weapon's physical damage.
"Lifeberries," a.k.a. Goodberries that have been buffed due to being cast by a Life Domain Cleric, will only get the additional healing benefit from Disciple of Life if the same Cleric who cast the spell is also the one to consume the berry. If somebody else consumes the berry, they will just get the normal 1d4 that a goodberry gets in BG3.
If a character with extra attack makes a melee or ranged weapon attack first, they may follow it up with a thrown weapon attack. However, making a thrown weapon attack first causes the game to classify it as a full throw action rather than part of the attack action, consuming your entire attack action.

Larian Studios' Fan Content Policy

We quote:

"We greatly value interaction with our community and you keep surprising us with the projects you come up with (Fan Content).
We are getting a lot of questions about what you can or can’t do with Larian Studios’ intellectual property (IP). While we tend to be liberal about what we allow, we do need to set some boundaries to protect our interests.
So here are the 5 guidelines we ask you to live/work/create by:
1. Keep it FREE. You can use Larian Studios’ IP (except for the restrictions listed in #3) to make Fan Content you share with the community for free. Free means:

You can’t require payments, surveys, downloads, subscriptions, or email registration to access your Fan Content;
You can’t sell or license your Fan Content to any third parties for any type of compensation; and
Your Fan Content must be free for others (including Larian Studios) to view, access, share, and use without paying you anything or seeking your permission.
To be clear, we don’t have a problem with you taking advantage of sponsorships, ad revenue, and donations—so long as:

You don’t use a sponsor that would be harmful to Larian Studios, like endorsing offensive or polarizing sponsors;
You make it clear (verbally or visually) that they are acting as a sponsor only;
You do not associate Larian Studios with your sponsor in any way; and
The sponsoring does not interfere with the community’s access to your Fan Content.
2. Keep it clear it’s FAN Content. When sharing your creations, don’t create confusion about the nature of your work. Make sure it’s clear, that your content is not endorsed or sponsored by Larian Studios—i.e. its unofficial.
3. Keep it honest. Respect people’s IP, both ours and that of others.
This means, we ask you:

Not to use Larian Studios’ logos and trademarks.
Not to tinker with the legal notices in our creations. If the Larian Studios IP you are incorporating into your Fan Content already has copyright notices, logos, trademarks, or other notices existing within it, don’t remove them;
Not to use our IP in other games. This includes your own or other people’s games or game components (e.g. rule books, tokens, figures), regardless of whether it is distributed for free;
Don’t use Larian Studios’ Video or Music in your Fan Content.  Simply embedding a video from an authorized third-party’s website (e.g., Twitch or YouTube) is ok though.
As well as to:

Refrain from using other people’s stuff in your Content. If we learn that your Fan Content also includes other people’s IP (e.g., crossovers/mashups) without their permission, we may ask you to take it down.
4. Keep it clean. We reserve the right to stop or restrict your use of Larian Studios’ IP at any time, including when we think your use is inappropriate, offensive, damaging, or disparaging (and we’ll make that call in our sole discretion). If this happens, you must immediately take down your Fan Content.
5. Keep it legit. It’s your Fan Content, so you are solely responsible for ensuring that your creations don’t violate the laws of your region. In addition to this Policy, your use of any Larian Studios’ IP must also comply with Larian Studios’ terms of use.
If you have any questions or the Fan Content you want to make isn’t covered by this Policy, contact us via community@larian.com. We’ll reply back as soon as we can. Please understand that if you don’t hear from us, it does not mean we approve of your requested use of Larian Studios’ IP."

Concentration - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Concentration

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Concentration is a special Resource used by certain Spells. A spell with the  Concentration tag requires the caster to focus on that spell for its duration.
A caster may only maintain the effect of one  Concentration spell at a time. 

Losing Concentration[edit | edit source]
There are several ways to lose focus and drop the effects of a  Concentration spell:

Casting any other spell with the  Concentration tag
Becoming Incapacitated
Being knocked Prone
Being reduced to 0 hit points (Downed)
Taking damage and failing the associated Concentration Saving Throw
Concentration Saving Throw[edit | edit source]
Taking damage while concentrating on a spell forces a Concentration Saving Throw, a special type of Constitution Saving Throw.

The Difficulty Class of this saving throw is: Difficulty Class: (Damage Taken)/2
The Minimum Difficulty Class is 10.
If this saving throw succeeds, concentration is maintained. If it fails, concentration is lost and the spell's effect ends.

If no prayer is offered to the mirror prior to sacrificing memories, no bonus is received, only the penalty.

Weapons - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Weapons

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Weapons serve the purpose of dealing damage to various things, ranging from doors and crates to monsters and NPCs.
See also: List of all weapon types
There are a number of ways to categorize items:

Martial or Simple
Melee or Ranged
One-handed, Two-handed, or Versatile
Each weapon deals a specific type of physical damage:  Bludgeoning,  Piercing, or  Slashing.
Versatile weapons can be wielded in one hand, or both hands.  Wielding them in both hands usually grants higher damage; see the details of each Versatile weapon for the one-handed and two-handed damage values.
One-handed weapons can be dual-wielded if both weapons have the Light property.  The Dual Wielder Feat removes this limitation and also allows dual-wielding of Versatile weapons, which are never Light.
Proficiency in the equipped main hand weapon unlocks Weapon Actions unique to its weapon type. Off-hand weapons do not grant Weapon Actions.

Properties[edit | edit source]
Weapons can have various special properties, though not all are implemented in the game as of now:

Property
Description

Ammunition

(Not implemented.)  You need ammunition to be able to attack.  You can regain half of your spent ammunition after a battle by spending one minute to search the area.

Enchantment (+1, +2, +3)

This weapon is magically enchanted. It overcomes resistances to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage from non-magical weapons. You also add the corresponding bonuses (+1, +2, etc.) to any attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.

Finesse

You use the higher one of your Strength and Dexterity for attack and damage rolls.

Heavy

(Not implemented.)  Small creatures have  Disadvantage on attack rolls.

Light

Can be wielded in your off-hand as a secondary weapon, if your main-hand weapon is also light.

Loading

(Not implemented.)  You can only make one attack with this weapon when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make with that specific action type.

Range

Every ranged weapon has a normal range and a long range.  Creatures that are beyond normal range but within long range can be attacked, albeit with  Disadvantage.  Creatures outside of long range cannot be attacked.

Reach

A melee weapon with this property can be used to attack enemies up to 2.5 m / 8 ft away, instead of the regular 1.5 m / 5 ft.

Silvered

(Not implemented.)  Some monsters are immune or resistant to nonmagical weapons, but susceptible to silver weapons.

Special

Various special rules apply to the weapon, explained in its description.

Thrown

A melee weapon with this property can be thrown for a ranged attack, and will benefit from the Ability Score Modifier (Strength) and Proficiency Bonus as usual, instead of being treated as an Improvised Weapon.  This combines with the Finesse property: if you throw a Dagger, which has both Thrown and Finesse, you can use your Dexterity Modifier for the attack and damage rolls.

Two-handed

Indicates that this is a two-handed weapon. It has to be wielded with both hands when making an attack with it, but can still be just carried in one.

Versatile

Indicates that this is a versatile weapon.  It can be used with one hand or both hands.  Typically, using a versatile weapon with both hands offers a higher maximum damage.

Martial Weapons[edit | edit source]
Martial weapons require extensive training to effectively use in combat.  Martial Classes such as Barbarian, Fighter, Paladin, and Ranger have Proficiency with all martial weapons at Level 1.  Otherwise, one can obtain martial proficiency by taking the appropriate Feat at Level 4.  A creature's Race and Class may also grant it proficiency with specific types of martial weapons; see Proficiencies granted by Race and Class below.

Melee Martial Weapons

One-Handed

Versatile

Two-Handed

 Morningstars
 Rapiers
 Scimitars
 Shortswords
 War Picks

 Halberds
 Mauls
 Pikes

Ranged Martial Weapons

Two-Handed

 Hand Crossbows

(none)

 Heavy Crossbows

Simple Weapons[edit | edit source]
Simple weapons are easy to learn and use.  Every Class except Druid, Wizard, and Sorcerer is proficient with all simple weapons at Level 1.  Otherwise, one can obtain simple weapon proficiency by taking the appropriate Feat at Level 4.  A creature's Race and Class may also grant it proficiency with specific types of simple weapons; see Proficiencies granted by Race and Class below.

Druid: Club, Dagger, Javelin, Mace, Quarterstaff, Sickle, Spear
Wizard, Sorcerer: Dagger, Quarterstaff, Light Crossbow

Improvised Weapons[edit | edit source]
Objects that aren't actually weapons can nevertheless be used as Improvised Weapons.  One can gain Proficiency in these by choosing the corresponding Feat when leveling up.  Note that this is not the same as using a non-weapon item that resembles a weapon strongly enough to allow it to be used as such.  For example, when Salami is used as a weapon, it actually functions as a Club, not as an Improvised Weapon.

Weapon Properties Table[edit | edit source]
The following table summarizes all weapon types in the game and provides a quick overview of their properties.  The columns 1H-dmg and 2H-dmg list the dice rolled for one-handed and two-handed damage, as well as the average damage this will provide.
If the Range column is empty, it indicates a standard melee range of 1.5 m / 5 ft, while Reach stands for the extended melee range of 2.5 m / 8 ft and Thrown indicates that the weapon can be thrown up to a maximum of 18 m / 60 ft.  The ranges listed for ranged weapons is their normal range; they also have an extended range which is double, but confers  Disadvantage on the Attack Roll.

Gameplay[edit | edit source]
As a Warlock of The Fiend subclass, Wyll gains access to powerful destructive Spells as he levels up. He gains fewer Spell Slots per day than traditional spellcasters, but in exchange, he regains use of them on a Short Rest and his spells are always cast at the highest level possible, making even his low level spells quite potent.
Wyll can use his versatile Eldritch Blast cantrip and Eldritch Invocations to help fill the gaps created by his limited spell slots. 

Passive Features[edit | edit source]
The Blade of Frontiers[edit | edit source]
The Champion of the Sword Coast, renowned for his heroic deeds, unusual stone eye, and notable distaste for Goblins.

Recruitment[edit | edit source]
Wyll can be recruited in Chapter One.

Wyll is first encountered when approaching the Druid Grove in the Wilderness. On approach, Goblins will attack the grove and Wyll will participate in the battle, announcing himself as the Blade of Frontiers, and defending the grove. Afterwards, he can be found in the The Hollow training Tiefling children to fight. If the player speaks with him there and agrees to join forces with him, he will join the party.

Background[edit | edit source]
Wyll used to be a stubborn young man, failing to make his wealthy family proud as an unskilled Flaming Fist. Goblins torched a village that Wyll was stationed in, slaughtering his fellow Flaming Fist. Among them was Spike, a goblin who gouged out Wyll's right eye and left him to burn. Wyll survived, and vowed to the Heavens and Hells that he would make Spike pay.
When a woman rose from the ashes of the village and offered Wyll the power to defeat his enemies, he accepted, sealing the Warlock's pact with his new patron, Mizora, a Cambion. She gave him a new eye, a Sending Stone, which could be used to communicate with him.
With his new power, Wyll quickly gained fame as The Blade of Frontiers.

  Spoiler warning! This section reveals details about the story of Baldur's Gate 3.

Wyll's Pact
During the course of the story, you can learn some of the clauses of Wyll's pact with Mizora.
Clause F § 9: 'Soul-binder shall bestow reward or favour only upon soul-bearer's fulfillment of related obligation.'
Clause Z § 13: 'Should the promised soul refuse obeyance or neglect duty, the pact-holder shall cast the promised in Avernus as a lemure.'
Clause Z § 13: 'If the soul-binder consents to separation, she will release the soul-bearer from all obligation within six months.'

Personality[edit | edit source]
Wyll actively seeks to do the right thing and live up to his ideal vision of a hero, even if at times he considers himself undeserving of the title. When few options remain, Wyll is willing to resort to brutal methods if in his eyes the ends justify the means. He is desperate to free himself from the shame of his past and be recognized as something greater. Because of this, his deeds can at times appear reckless. He enjoys his title as the Blade of Frontiers even though he regrets what it cost him to obtain it.

Interactions[edit | edit source]
Approval[edit | edit source]
Wyll likes acts of heroism, defending the innocent or defenseless, and killing goblins.
The following story and dialogue choices will cause Wyll to gain approval.

Weapon Actions - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Weapon Actions

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Weapon Actions are a type of Action granted to a character based on the type of weapon they are wielding. For example, bladed weapons such as Longswords will typically grant the Lacerate weapon action.
These actions are only usable once per Short Rest and are special in some way, normally able to do bonus damage, hit multiple targets, debilitate foes, or move the character.
In order to gain access to the Weapon Actions from a weapon, a creature must have Proficiency in that weapon type and have it equipped in the main hand or both hands (off-hand weapons do not grant Weapon Actions).
In Early Access, the difficulty class (or DC) of Weapon Actions is equal to your Spellcasting DC, because BG3 treats weapon actions like spells. Refer to Spellcasting Ability and Proficiency for more information.

Example of a character readying an Illithid power

Notes[edit | edit source]
In Early Access, the progression of your powers worked differently. Instead, your tadpole grew in power as you used Illithid Persuasion options in dialogue. Once you'd used Illithid Persuasion three times, you got a power unique to your class. Some of these abilities were reworked into the current Illithid Powers. A full list of Early Access powers can be seen below:

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
  The Reactions menu panel
 Reaction is one type of Resource available to characters during a combat round. Reactions allow characters to execute various abilities, such as Attack of Opportunity or casting certain Spells (those which cost a Reaction).
Unlike Actions and Bonus Actions, many Reactions are executed outside of a character's turn.
Characters normally receive one Reaction per combat round. Reaction settings can be configured in the Reactions menu panel (default hotkey: L).

List of Reactions[edit | edit source]
 Attack of Opportunity
 Cutting Words

 Hellish Rebuke

Notes[edit | edit source]
See also: Category:Reactions
As of Early Access Patch 9:

Some passive features, like Great Weapon Master: All In, are described as 'Reactions' but do not actually consume the Reaction resource.
Some Reactions, like Attack of Opportunity, do not appear in the Reactions menu and can only be toggled from the Passives tab on the hotbar.

Campsite - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Campsite

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
 The campsite at night
The Campsite is a Location within Chapter One, and becomes accessible after the player completes the Prologue. This is a special location that the player discovers when they first initiates a long rest, and can subsequently be travelled to similarly or through fast travel. Spoiler warning: The following content may contain story spoilers. Read at your own risk.
Contents

1 Purpose and Usage
2 Waypoints
3 Related Quests
4 Notable NPCs

Purpose and Usage[edit | edit source]
In the Early Access, the night-time version of the campsite serves as the primary location for Long Resting, and reforming the party composition. It is also a key location to progress the main and companion stories through camp conversations. 
The day-time version of the camp is accessed whenever the player chooses to arrive at it through fast travel. The player may also appear here instead of in the World Map after resting if certain camp cutscenes that don't trigger automatically are available.
The appearance of the Campsite depends on the current environment, and evolves as the story progresses after gathering more companions and allies.

Waypoints[edit | edit source]
This location does not contain any waypoints, but can be fast travelled to at any point. Arriving in the campsite this way triggers the day-time version of the location. 

Related Quests[edit | edit source]

Proficiency - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Proficiency

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search

The Proficiency system is how the game determines whether to add a creature's Proficiency Bonus to a Die Roll.  One can have Proficiency in Weapons, Armour, Shields, Spellcasting, Saving Throws, and Skills.

Contents

1 Weapon Proficiency
2 Armour Proficiency
3 Shield Proficiency
4 Spellcasting Proficiency
5 Saving Throw Proficiency
6 Skill Proficiency

6.1 Background Skill Proficiencies
6.2 Racial Skill Proficiencies
6.3 Class Skill Proficiencies

6.3.1 Ranger
6.3.2 Bard
6.3.3 Warlock

6.4 Expertise

7 Instrument Proficiency

Weapon Proficiency[edit | edit source]
A creature can be proficient in entire categories of Weapons (Martial or Simple), or it can be proficient in specific weapon types such as Longswords, Longbows, etc.  These proficiencies can be granted by the creature's Race, Class, or Feats chosen when leveling up.
When a creature is proficient in a wielded weapon, they add their Proficiency Bonus to Attack Rolls with that weapon.  When the weapon is equipped in the main hand, it also enables special properties and actions of that weapon type, such as Tenacity, Piercing Strike, Flourish, Lacerate, Pommel Strike, and so on.

Armour Proficiency[edit | edit source]
Main page: Armour
A creature may have Proficiency in  Light Armour,  Medium Armour, and/or  Heavy Armour. Some Helmets, Gloves, and Boots also require Proficiency in a certain type of armour.
Wearing armour without Proficiency in that armour type will impose  Disadvantage on all of your Ability Checks, Saving Throws, and Attack Rolls, and prevent you from casting Spells.

Shield Proficiency[edit | edit source]
Main page: Shields
 Shields are a piece of equipment wielded in the offhand weapon slot. Shield Proficiency typically comes paired with  Medium Armour Proficiency.
Wielding a shield without Proficiency in Shields will impose  Disadvantage on all of your Ability Checks, Saving Throws, and Attack Rolls, and prevent you from casting Spells.

Spellcasting Proficiency[edit | edit source]
All creatures capable of spellcasting on the regular (i.e., without the use of magical items or scrolls) have proficiency in spellcasting.  This means that the creature's Proficiency Bonus will be added to the Attack Rolls of spells, and to the Difficulty Class of Saving Throws imposed on others via spells.  Although all spellcasters have it, the lack of spellcasting proficiency can nevertheless become apparent, when a creature not regularly capable of casting spells does so through the use of a magical item or scroll.

Saving Throw Proficiency[edit | edit source]
Having proficiency in a type of Saving Throw such as Strength Save, Dexterity Save, and so on, means that the creature making the save can add its Proficiency Bonus to the result.  Each Class provides proficiency in two types of saving throw.

In addition, a Ranger who chooses Urban Tracker as their favoured environment gains Sleight of Hand proficiency.

Bard[edit | edit source]
A Bard of the College of Lore subclass can choose three additional Skills to gain proficiency in.  (Note: As of Early Access Patch 9, this is locked to Arcana, Intimidation, and Sleight of Hand, rather than allowing the Bard to choose.)

Warlock[edit | edit source]
Warlocks can gain proficiency in Deception and Persuasion by selecting the Beguiling Influence Eldritch Invocation when leveling up.

Expertise[edit | edit source]
 Expertise is a deeper form of Skill Proficiency, allowing a creature to add double its Proficiency Bonus when making a corresponding Skill Check.

Rogues gain Expertise in two Skills they are proficient in at level 1.
Bards gain Expertise in two Skills they are proficient in at level 3.
Instrument Proficiency[edit | edit source]
Instruments can be used to entertain and distract crowds. When a character proficient in instruments plays one, nearby people might approach and gather to listen. If they perform well on a Performance check, those gathered might toss gold at to the performer as well.

Recruitment[edit | edit source]
Shadowheart can be recruited in Chapter One.

Shadowheart is first encountered on the Nautiloid during the Prologue, trapped inside a Mind Flayer pod. She can be freed by interacting with the nearby console or using certain class-restricted dialogue options on the pod. If she is freed, she will join the party as a temporary companion. Upon escaping the Nautiloid, she leaves the party.
Shadowheart is encountered again a second time at the Ravaged Beach inside the Wilderness. If she was freed from the pod during the Prologue, she will be unconscious on the ground and wake up when interacted with. If she was not freed, she will instead be found attempting to gain entry to the nearby Dank Crypt. Either way, she can be invited to join the party after speaking with her.
If Shadowheart is not interacted with at the Ravaged Beach, she will move to the Druid Grove on her own in search of a healer. She can be spoken with there and invited to join the party.

Background[edit | edit source]
A loyal cleric of Shar, Shadowheart is the sole survivor of a holy mission undertaken on the Mistress of the Night's behest. She alone must deliver a relic of immense power to her coven in Baldur's Gate, while threatened by a strange new magic that is burgeoning from within.

Personality[edit | edit source]
Shadowheart is guarded and hesitant to reveal information about herself, her motives, or the relic she carries.  She displays a particular distrust of Githyanki such as Lae'zel. Often, she seems indifferent to the plight of others; however, she does not explicitly take pleasure in their suffering, and will disapprove of unnecessary cruelty and violence.  She will usually approve of finding non-violent solutions to situations, and treating animals and children with compassion. Above all, Shadowheart values pragmatism.

Interactions[edit | edit source]
Approval[edit | edit source]
Shadowheart likes finding pragmatic and efficient solutions to problems. She appreciates discretion, privacy, and open-mindedness. Shadowheart generally responds well to acts of heroism.
The following story and dialogue choices will cause Shadowheart to gain approval.

  Spoiler warning! This section reveals details about the story of Baldur's Gate 3.

Similarly to other characters, her first important romance scene will be unlocked during the Party by proposing to have a drink in private with you. Shadowheart will only propose it to you if you sided with the Tieflings and if you have at least medium approval. You'll meet her away from camp later that night, where you will have a deep conversation. After some dialogue, the camera fades and returns a few hours later showing both of you laying on the ground, holding hands. You can choose to kiss her, and then both will return to camp. 
Next day, you can have a conversation with her regarding the previous night. Her dialogue will depend on her level of approval.

Trivia[edit | edit source]
Shadowheart is voiced by Jennifer English.
According to Larian Studios, until Patch 3, Shadowheart was the most romanced female companion and the second most romanced companion overall.

The Dark Urge is a special Origin in Baldur's Gate 3. The Dark Urge gives a custom character a special origin background and adds many new interactions, obstacles, and story elements for that character.
Unlike the other Origin Characters, The Dark Urge can be played using any race, class, and gender, and will not be part of the player's party if they are playing any other Origin Character, although The Dark Urge may be encountered as an NPC in the world.

Background[edit | edit source]
You remember nothing of your past besides that you walked a path paved with blood. As you venture on, you find yourself inescapably drawn towards unimaginable cruelties. Where do these thoughts come from?

Gameplay[edit | edit source]
A character with The Dark Urge Origin remembers nothing of their past and are plagued with sick, dark urges of violence and cruelty. Like the other Origin Characters, The Dark Urge adds a unique storyline that surfaces over time as the true nature of The Dark Urge is revealed.
While playing as The Dark Urge, players will be forced to resist or succumb to the temptation of the darkness inside them. Resisting may not always be easy to do, and characters trying to follow a path of morality and good will have to overcome their inner struggle in order to remain true to their ideals. It is possible to play this Origin as both an evil villain, a good hero, or anything in-between.
Guiding the Dark Urge in their time of need is Sceleritas Fel. A vile and loyal servant, Fel lives only to see the Dark Urge return to their rightful, bloodstained path and urges them to commit some of the most lurid acts of violence.

Resting - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Resting

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
Resting is the primary way the player and their companions can restore lost Hit Points and uses of their Spell Slots, class abilities, and certain items.
There are two types of resting: Long Rests and Short Rests.

Long Rest[edit | edit source]
 Starting a long rest at camp
To begin a Long Rest, use the Waypoint system or the Resting icon to go to the Campsite. 
Interacting with one of the bedrolls around the campfire, the campfire itself, or using the Long Rest button again when inside the Campsite ends the day and restores all of the following:

All Hit Points
All uses of Spell Slots
All class ability uses
All Short Rests available to the party
Use of certain item actions
Once-per-long-rest special Illithid Power dialogue options
This requires expending 40 Camp Supplies (regardless of the number of characters in the party this amount is always 40).

Alternatively, the player can do a Partial Long Rest, by not expending 40 Camp Supplies.
When performing a partial rest, the Long Rest will instead only do the following:

Restore Hit Points up to half of their maximum
Restore up to half of the character's maximum Spell Slots
Short Rests are not restored when performing a partial rest.

Many Companion interactions and dialogues will occur when Long Resting. Long rests can also advance certain time-sensitive story elements.

Short Rest[edit | edit source]
Twice per Long Rest, the party can take a Short Rest. This heals each party member for an amount of Hit Points equal to half their maximum (rounded down). Some classes also receive additional benefits from short rests, including but not limited to:

Warlocks regain their Spell Slots
Clerics regain their Channel Divinity charge
Paladins regain their Channel Oath charge
Fighters regain the use of their Action Surge ability
In addition, all uses of Weapon Actions are restored by Short Resting.
The level 2 Bard ability,  Song of Rest, can grant the party an additional Short Rest.

Ability Score Modifier - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Ability Score Modifier

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see Die Rolls.
An Ability Score Modifier is a Die Roll modifier based on an Ability Score of a creature.  It can affect every type of roll.  Depending on the Ability Score in question, it can be shortened to Strength Modifier, Dexterity Modifier, Constitution Modifier, and so on.

Contents

1 When it's applied

1.1 Attack Roll
1.2 Damage Roll
1.3 Saving Throw
1.4 Ability Check

2 Value

When it's applied[edit | edit source]
Attack Roll[edit | edit source]
During Attack Rolls with Weapons, the attacking creature's Strength or Dexterity will be used to determine the Modifier.  See the linked Attack Roll and Weapon pages for details.
For a spell that uses an Attack Roll, the Ability Score to be used depends on the Class of the creature casting the spell.  For example, a Wizard uses Intelligence, a Cleric uses Wisdom, and a Sorcerer uses Charisma.  See the Attack Roll page for details.

Damage Roll[edit | edit source]
For Damage Rolls made with Weapons, the exact same rules apply as for the Attack Roll.
For spells, the Ability Score Modifier is normally not used, though there are exceptions.  For example, the class feature Agonising Blast allows a Warlock to add their Charisma Modifier to the damage of Eldritch Blast; and the spell Shillelagh imbues a weapon with magic, such that it benefits from the wielder's Wisdom Modifier.

Saving Throw[edit | edit source]
Each Saving Throw is tied to a certain Ability Score, which determines its type, such as Strength Saving Throw, Dexterity Saving Throw, and so on, which determines the Ability Score Modifier that will be used.

Ability Check[edit | edit source]
The Ability Check is similar to the Saving Throw in that it's categorized based on the Ability Score used.  (The clue is in the name.)
A special type of Ability Check is the Skill Check, where a specific skill like Athletics, Perception, Sleight of Hand, etc. is used, but each Skill maps one to one to a corresponding Ability Score, so the Ability Score Modifier still applies.  For example, Athletics is based on Strength, whereas Sleight of Hand is based on Dexterity.

Value[edit | edit source]
Following is the table for the Ability Score Modifier value based on how high the corresponding Ability Score of a creature is:

Spells are magical energies from the multiverse conjured by spellcasters (Wizard, Sorcerer, Druid, Warlock, etc.) through experience, knowledge, or innate ability to create magical Effects, deal damage to enemies, or heal their allies. 
See: List of all spells
All spellcasters are proficient with Spell Attacks. When they make an Attack Roll with a Spell, they roll against the target's Armour Class (or AC):

 D20 + Proficiency Bonus + Spellcasting Ability Modifier
Spells which do not invoke an Attack Roll often require the target to roll a Saving Throw against the spellcaster's spellcasting Difficulty Class (or DC):

8 + Proficiency Bonus + Spellcasting Ability Modifier

Spell Slots[edit | edit source]
Spell Slots are the spellcasters' Resource used to cast Spells. Once Spell Slots are depleted, they can only be regained through a Long Rest, with the following notable exceptions:

Certain classes like Wizard and some Druid subclasses have the ability to regain a small number of Spell Slots once per Long Rest.
Warlocks only need to take a Short Rest to fully regain their Spell Slots.
Spell Slot Levels[edit | edit source]
Each Spell Slot has a level that corresponds to the level of spells that can be cast using that slot:  Level 1,  Level 2,  Level 3, and so on.
Cantrips  do not consume any spell slots and are effectively an infinite resource.
Due to their unique mechanics, the spell slots of a Warlock are colored differently, like so: 

Upcasting[edit | edit source]
Upcasting refers to when a spellcaster chooses to use a higher level spell slot to cast a lower level spell. Many spells gain additional damage dice, area of effect, targets, or other effects when upcast, but some spells gain no additional benefit. Warlock spells are always upcast to their highest known spell level.

The total amount of spell slots a spellcaster would get is dependent upon their Effective Spellcaster Level (ESL). For full spellcasters ( Bards,  Clerics,  Druids,  Sorcerers, and  Wizards) this is exactly their class level (A level 5 wizard has an Effective Spellcaster Level of 5); "Half-spellcasters" ( Rangers and  Paladins), are not considered spellcasters until class level 2, at which point their Effective Spellcaster Level is their class level halved. "One-third-spellcasters"  ( Arcane Trickster Rogues and  Eldritch Knight Fighters) are all subclasses that can only be taken at class level three, their Effective Spellcaster Level is their class level divided by three. For the purpose of determining Spell Slot Distribution the Effective Spellcaster Level is rounded up.
Once the Effective Spellcaster Level is known, one can consult the following table to find out their character's spell slot distribution: 
The number of spell slot for each level across ESL has no clear pattern, but when a spell level opens up does have an identifiable pattern. The maximum spell level a spellcaster has access to is their ESL halved and then rounded up.
 Warlocks are unique in this regard, their spell slots are all of a uniform level, matching the highest spell slot available of a normal full spellcaster class until spell level 5, which is the highest level spell slot warlocks can have. They also simply gain a spell slot at class level 1,2, and 11.

Concentration[edit | edit source]
Main page: Concentration
 Concentration is another type of resource a spellcaster has. Certain spells require the caster to continuously put focus into the spell in order to maintain its effects, such spells are called  Concentration spells, and this requirement will be clearly labeled with the  Concentration tag in the spell's description. The caster may still do other actions while concentrating, but are at risk of losing said concentration under certain circumstances. If the caster loses Concentration, the spell ends prematurely. A caster can only concentrate on one spell at a time, said spell will be shown on top of/next to the caster's portrait.
When the caster takes damage, they must make a Constitution Saving Throw ( D20 + Constitution Modifier) to maintain Concentration. The result must match or exceed a DC of 10 or half the number of damage they received, whichever is higher.

Ways you can lose Concentration while maintaining Concentration Spells:
Failing a Concentration Check by taking damage.
Casting another Concentration Spell.
Being affected by Conditions such as Downed, Sleeping, Rage, etc.
Voluntarily ending the concentration effect. (This is done by clicking the x button on the concentrated spell's icon on top of/next to the caster's portrait)
Spellcasting Ability and Proficiency[edit | edit source]
Every class, even non-spellcasters, has an ability specifically designated to represent their ability to cast spells. This ability would be that class's Spellcasting Ability, the Ability Score Modifier of said Spellcasting Ability is directly added to the difficulty for which the spellcaster's targets face when trying to mitigate the effects of most spells from said spellcaster. This added difficulty-to-resist is more simply known as the spellcaster's Spellcasting Ability Modifier.
Non-spellcasters typically only cast spells by using magical items (which include scrolls), however, they are not considered Proficient spellcasters. Whereas actual Spellcasters are considered Proficient at spellcasting, whether with learned spells or magical items. Spellcasting Proficiency has similar function to Spellcasting Ability Modifier.
For more details, see the Saving Throw and Attack Roll pages for a comprehensive explanation of how the Spellcasting Ability Modifier and Spellcasting Proficiency is applied.
Each class uses a different Ability Score Modifier for spellcasting:

 Intelligence (INT):  Wizards,  Fighters*†, and  Rogues*†.
 Wisdom (WIS):  Clerics,  Rangers,  Druids, and  Monks*.
 Charisma (CHA): Bards,  Paladins,  Sorcerers,  Warlocks, and  Barbarians*.
*Non-spellcasters
†These classes, while normally non-spellcasters, have the option of becoming spellcasters by specializing into specific subclasses ( Arcane Trickster Rogues and  Eldritch Knight Fighters)

NB: Occasionally, specific spells will designate its own Spellcasting Ability regardless of the class in question, this is most commonly a result of spells obtained via racial features.

Prepared Spells[edit | edit source]
Prepared Spells are Spells that must be prepared beforehand in order to be cast, this can only be done outside of combat. Spellcasters that primarily utilizes this type of spells are known as Prepared Spellcasters. This includes:

 Cleric
 Druid
 Paladin
 Wizard
These spellcasters will need to anticipate which spells would be useful in advance. In exchange, these classes will have access to every class-level-appropriate spell in their Spell List.
Uniquely, Wizards are prepared casters that can only choose a subset of eligible spells to be learnt on leveling up, but are allowed to learn more spells by transcribing scrolls.
The number of Prepared Spells each class can have at a time is equal to (Spellcasting Ability Modifier + Class Level) (Minimum of 1)
For this purpose a Paladin's class level is halved and rounded down.

Known Spells[edit | edit source]
Known Spells are spells permanently memorized by a spellcaster, meaning these Spells are functionally Always Prepared. Spellcasters that primarily utilizes this type of spells are known as Spontaneous Spellcasters. This includes:

 Arcane Trickster Rogue
 Bard
 Eldritch Knight Fighter
 Ranger
 Sorcerer
 Warlock
These spellcasters will not need to worry about spell preparation. In exchange, they can only learn a subset of their class's Spell List.
Spontaneous Spellcasters have access to the Replacement Spell feature, which allows them to swap a known spell each time they level up.
Additionally, Spells granted by Races or by certain Subclasses (such as Cleric Domains) are considered "inherent" and is Always Prepared. This happens even if the character in question has a class that is normally is a Prepared Spellcaster.

Ritual Spells[edit | edit source]
Ritual spells are a special type of spell. When a Ritual Spell is cast outside of combat, they do not consume spell slots and are effectively free to cast. They consume spell slots as normal in-combat.
Ritual spells include:
Detect Thoughts
Disguise Self
Enhance Leap
Feather Fall
Find Familiar
Longstrider
Silence
Speak with Animals
Speak with Dead

Saving Throw - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Saving Throw

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see Die Rolls.
A Saving Throw, also called a save (and depending on the ability it's tied to, Strength Save, Dexterity Save, etc.), is a die roll the game makes for a creature to decide whether it can avoid or reduce the harmful effects of various threats, such as a spell, poison, trap, and so on.  The creature's Ability Score Modifier and Proficiency Bonus (if proficient in that type of saving throw) are added to the roll.

Result =  D20 + Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus (if proficient)

Each Saving Throw is tied to an Ability Score that determines its type.  Accordingly, it can be referred to as a Strength Save, Dexterity Save, Constitution Save, and so on.  For a save to succeed, it must reach or exceed a value known as the Difficulty Class (DC).

3 Effects of a Successful Saving Throw

Modifiers[edit | edit source]
Saving Throws are affected by the Ability Score Modifier of the ability they're tied to.  In addition to that, a creature can be proficient in a type of Saving Throw, allowing it to add its Proficiency Bonus to the roll.
Saving Throws can also be affected by  Advantage or  Disadvantage.  For example, Elves have Advantage on Saving Throws against being Charmed.  As another example, the Bleeding condition incurs Disadvantage on Constitution Saves.
Some spells can also affect a saving throw, such as Bane, Bless, and Resistance.

Ability Score Modifier[edit | edit source]

Proficiency Bonus[edit | edit source]

As explained above, a creature needs Proficiency in the corresponding type of Saving Throw for its Proficiency Bonus to apply.  Each Class provides a creature Proficiency in two types of Saving Throw:

The Difficulty Class of Saving Throws[edit | edit source]
If a creature casts a spell that forces another to make a save, the DC is determined according to the properties of the spell caster, using the following formula:

Difficulty Class = 8 + Ability Score Modifier + Proficiency Bonus

The Ability Score used to determine the Modifier depends on the class of the caster, and is the same as the one used for the Attack Roll:

Classes sorted by which Ability Score they use for Spellcasting

Intelligence
Wisdom
Charisma

Wizard
Arcane Trickster (Rogue)
Eldritch Knight (Fighter)

Cleric
Druid
Ranger

Bard
Paladin
Sorcerer
Warlock
Barbarian (Scrolls only)

In Baldur's Gate 3, the same ability modifiers apply when casting a spell from a Scroll, even when the spell being cast is not normally available to your class. For instance, a Cleric casting  Shatter (a spell not normally available to Clerics) from a scroll adds its Wisdom modifier to the Saving Throw DC.
The Proficiency needed to gain the Proficiency Bonus is spellcasting.  All creatures capable of casting spells through their Class, Subclass, or Feats have this proficiency.  If a creature that can't normally cast spells uses a scroll or other item to cast one, it will also receive its Proficiency Bonus on the Attack Roll or Saving Throw DC of that spell.
In the case of threats that don't originate from a spell caster, such as a trap or a poisonous apple, the game sets the DC based on how serious the threat is supposed to be.  For example, a rather ineffective trap could have a DC of just 5, whereas a very powerful one could have a DC of 15.  A slightly spoiled tart could impose a Constitution Save of DC 5, whereas a potent venom from a snake could impose a DC 15 Constitution Save on the hapless victim.

Effects of a Successful Saving Throw[edit | edit source]
Making a successful Saving Throw could mean avoiding negative effects entirely, or it could merely mean reducing the damage taken, usually by half.  Depending on the threat, there could also be other rules that determine what happens on a failed or successful save.

Races

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Jump to navigation
Jump to search

There are a great variety of Races that can be found in the Forgotten Realms and played in Baldur's Gate 3, both civilized and savage. A creature's race determines its lineage and innate powers and abilities.
All races have their own strengths and many possess unique abilities and powers. Sometimes creatures can even cast spells as a result of their racial heritage. 
Race affects NPC reactions and available interactions during conversations. Each race also has unique attack animations (while spellcasting animations are based on class).
See below for a list of races.

Human

Elf

Drow

Half-Elf

Half-Orc

Halfling

Dwarf

Gnome

Tiefling

Githyanki

Dragonborn

Overview of Playable Races[edit | edit source]
There are 11 playable races in Baldur's Gate 3. Many playable races are divided into subraces, which further defines a character's strengths, abilities, and appearance.
Refer to individual Race pages for further details.
Unless otherwise noted, spells gained from race may only be cast once per Long Rest.
In D&D 5e races tend to receive fixed ability score bonuses as racial bonuses. Baldur's Gate 3 instead awards each race the following ability score bonuses for the player to freely allocate:

+2 to any Ability Score
+1 to any other Ability Score

Advantage - Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki

Advantage

From Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki
(Redirected from Disadvantage)

Jump to navigation
Jump to search
For a comprehensive summary of the mechanics behind all rolls and modifiers, see: Die Rolls
 Advantage and  Disadvantage are a gameplay mechanic that can greatly affect the success of dice rolls.  They can apply to Attack Rolls, Saving Throws, and Ability Checks, but not to Damage Rolls.

Advantage[edit | edit source]
When you roll with  Advantage, you perform the roll twice, and use the higher result.  You can only have Advantage once; in other words, you'll never roll more than twice for a single attack or check due to Advantage.
Example: You roll two  D20 for an Attack Roll, because you have Advantage.  The results are 16 and 4.  Your effective result is 16.
Advantage is negated by Disadvantage.  The number of Advantages and Disadvantages you have is irrelevant.  Even if you have three sources of Advantage, a single source of Disadvantage will negate it.
Examples of situations that grant Advantage:

Attacking an enemy that is Restrained
Being unseen by the enemy while making an attack
Various spells and abilities that grant Advantage
Disadvantage[edit | edit source]
When you roll with  Disadvantage, you perform the roll twice, and use the lower result.  You can only have Disadvantage once; in other words, you'll never roll more than twice for a single attack or check due to Disadvantage.
Example: You roll two  D20 for an Attack Roll, because you have Disadvantage.  The results are 16 and 4.  Your effective result is 4.
Disadvantage is negated by Advantage.  The number of Advantages and Disadvantages you have is irrelevant.  Even if you have three sources of Disadvantage, a single source of Advantage will negate it.
Examples of situations that grant Disadvantage:

Trying to make a ranged attack against an enemy that is within 5ft of you
Trying to attack an enemy obscured by darkness
Various spells and abilities that grant Disadvantage
