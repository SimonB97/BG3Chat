# Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki Chatbot

Welcome to the Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki Chatbot repository! This educational project is a labor of love, designed to help fans of the game find the information they need quickly and easily. It's a simple tool, but one that I hope you'll find useful.

## Overview

This chatbot uses a combination of web scraping, natural language processing, and machine learning to provide answers to user queries about the game Baldur's Gate 3. It scrapes the Baldur's Gate 3 Wiki from [bg3.wiki](https://bg3.wiki/), builds an index of the content, and generates responses to user queries based on this indexed content. 

The chatbot is designed to be used with the Streamlit library for a user-friendly interface. It also uses the OpenAI API for generating responses and the BeautifulSoup library for web scraping.

## Installation

To get started, you'll need to clone this repository to your local machine. From there, you can install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You'll also need to provide your OpenAI API key, which you can get from the [OpenAI website](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

## Usage

Once you've installed the necessary dependencies and provided your OpenAI API key, you can start the chatbot by running the `BG3Chat.py` script:

```bash
python BG3Chat.py
```

This will start the Streamlit server and open the chatbot in your web browser.

## Using the Chatbot Settings

On the left side of the chatbot interface, you'll find a sidebar labeled "Chatbot Settings". Here, you can customize your chatbot experience. 

- **OpenAI API Key**: Enter your OpenAI API key here. This is necessary for the chatbot to function.
- **Summarize Chain Type**: Choose the method the chatbot uses to summarize the information it retrieves from the indexed wiki. Options include "stuff" (faster, limited documents), "map-reduce" (slower, unlimited documents), and "refine" (potentially more accurate for complex questions, slower, unlimited documents).
- **Model**: Select the model the chatbot uses to generate responses. Options include 'gpt-3.5-turbo-0613', 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', and 'gpt-4-0613'.
- **Number of documents retrieved per wiki search**: Use the slider to adjust the number of documents the chatbot retrieves for each search. More documents can provide more comprehensive answers, but may also slow down response time and lead to higher costs for OpenAI API usage.
